This is an excellent family story with a paranormal twist!\r\n\r\nYour family’s past is more interesting than any story. And it's not over yet...\r\n \r\nOne of my father’s stories was my favorite: “Once upon a time there lived a merchant with his wife. The family was happy and had never known grief. However, their maid, Julianne, was jealous of the little family's happiness and secretly dreamed of taking the place of a beloved wife. She learned of unholy powers hidden deep within the manor that could be summoned by a ritual … although there was a cost. She cursed the merchant's wife, unleashed deadly powers. The merchant vows to devote the rest of his life to finding a way to release his beloved wife from her cursed world.”\r\n\r\nYears have passed. My father dies, but he leaves me a message: “Your favorite fairy tale was the true story of our family. I tried to free your mother's spirit, but I failed. I beg you to finish what I could not. The solution is waiting in our old family home.”\r\n\r\nAs a son, I must “write” the happy ending for my family’s story.\r\n\r\nThis puzzle adventure is perfect for playing while traveling.

Use your cunning to kill or tame the primeval creatures roaming the land, and encounter other players to survive, dominate... and escape! \r\n\r\nTAME, TRAIN, BREED & RIDE DINOSAURS, IN A LIVING ECOSYSTEM\r\nOver 50 creatures can be tamed using a challenging subdue-&-protect process. Weaken a feral creature to knock it out, and then nursing it to health. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your Pet, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Pets continue to level-up and consume food, and carry Inventory and Equipment.  Fly a Pteranodon over the mountains, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, or chase down prey on a T-Rex! Experience a dynamic ecosystem with its own predator & prey hierarchies. Breed Pets through successive generations to generate the best traits. Or put more simply, breed & raise Dino Babies!\r\n\r\nFOOD, WATER, TEMPERATURE AND WEATHER\r\nEat and drink to survive, with different foods having different nutritional values (including human meat!). All actions drain food and water, and long-distance travel is draining. Inventory weight slows you down, and the day/night cycle and weather alter the environment. Craft clothing, build shelter, and use fire to protect yourself against damage & the elements.\r\n\r\nHARVEST, CRAFT, AND PAINT ITEMS\r\nHarvest trees, ore, and more to become a master crafter. Use your hands, a Smithy, or a Fabricator to craft increasingly complex and powerful gear. Build a massive base using modular pieces--ranging from Thatch, to Wood, to Stone, to Metal. Customize your base by painting it and placing signs that you can actually draw on. Weapons, clothing, & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.\r\n\r\nSUMMON THE ULTIMATE LIFE FORMS\r\nBring rare items to special Summon locations to awaken the ARK’s mythical creatures, who arrive ready for battle. These monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced Tribes and their Pets, and yield valuable items if they are defeated.\r\n\r\nRPG STATISTICS\r\nLevel-Up your survivor by gaining experience through in-game actions to learn new crafting Engrams, or find higher level item Blueprints in the most dangerous parts of the ARK. Customize the look of your character with a complex character creation system.\r\n\r\nHARDCORE MECHANICS\r\nItems have durability and wear out with use if not repaired. When you leave the game, your character remains “sleeping” in the persistent world. Your inventory also exists in the persistent world, vulnerable to theft. Death means permanent loss, and you can even enslave other players for your own purposes.\r\n\r\nLARGE WORLD PERSISTENCE\r\nOn the 70+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your pets stay in-game even when you leave. Special themed events will occur in the world with corresponding limited-run items!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5XHTN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Farming Simulator 16","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53245.13510798886401705.bf2dbe22-4ecf-4bfe-9367-d4f6488feb8b.a79db3d9-cc3a-4b5b-974e-2fef33ee089b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.26074.13510798886401705.990a0375-6b6a-4e95-838c-721849080d20.cce4f7ae-1a60-4e45-9bbe-f64c4360cb4a","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21943.13510798886401705.c62103f2-435b-432c-88a7-cc51412f11e7.02ed211f-e992-4f1d-b90d-6cf3e89bf3a9","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.20913.13510798886401705.5db45e0a-2355-4699-93aa-d6a3666b6807.2122f7cf-8e3e-45ba-9a88-8a055cda75ff","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47558.13510798886401705.9d9090a7-f54b-4fa7-a1bb-71b3e5813bd9.d595623c-d262-412c-b53b-37e738656cad","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63246.13510798886401705.e575f8e4-82f7-41a4-ad93-cd7227556898.380f565e-ea4e-4a9b-a9e7-14c6d12cadcf","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.3302.13510798886401705.b38fae70-a83e-48e2-ab24-84767975f09d.4b21788e-eabb-42b5-9fdb-8f9e1907ce1f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£2.49⁺","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":3.5,"RatingsCount":"96","PackageFamilyNames":["GIANTSSoftware.FarmingSimulator16_fa8jxm5fj0esw"],"ContentIds":["82a96a38-f620-6dfa-d4f5-2b96e93151ba","c824a97c-018c-909a-ead3-0a818f051506"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Manage your own farm and drive massive machines in an open world!\r\n\r\nFarming Simulator 16 allows you to manage your own realistic farm in extraordinary detail.

Design, build, and manage the city of your dreams, from public services to civic policies, and challenge yourself to grow from a simple town to a bustling metropolitan hub.\r\n\r\nCities: Skylines is an award-winning, best-selling management game, now available for Windows 10 with all of its robust city-simulation gameplay and unique charm along for the ride. The Windows 10 Edition includes the base game and the popular After Dark expansion, allowing players to plan and design for their cities’ nightlife and tourist attractions.\r\n\r\nMain Features:\r\n- Build the city of your dreams: Plan road networks, bus lines and parks. Bring on a smog-filled industrial revolution or create a quiet beach town ideal for tourists powered by renewable energy. Bring education, healthcare and safety to your citizens. Build it your way!\r\n\r\n- Multi-tiered and challenging simulation: Playing as the mayor of your city, you’ll be faced with balancing essential requirements such as education, water electricity, police, firefighting, healthcare and much more, along with your city’s economy. Citizens within your city react fluidly, keeping you on your toes with ever-evolving demands.\r\n\r\n- Extensive local traffic simulation: Managing traffic and the needs of your citizens to work and play will require the use of several interactive transport systems – use careful road planning alongside buses, trains, subways, and much more.\r\n\r\n- Districts and policies: Be more than just another city hall official!

Good thing Deep Rock Galactic employs the best space miners in the universe: Dwarves!

The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine.

If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too.

An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail.

His identity and intentions are unknown, but when he kidnaps your only son Nevin, you follow him in pursuit. As Gillian, explore two worlds and use the Magic Scrolls to discover the truth about a forgotten royal lineage.\n\nLong ago, the twin kingdoms destroyed each other in war. The White Kingdom was rebuilt with magic, but the Black Kingdom is still cursed - dark clouds envelop the sky, and dangerous vines destroy fields and houses. The noble Queen Mariette in the White Castle looks after her own subjects, but also supports the suffering inhabitants of the dark land. During your dangerous journey you will meet the inhabitants of both the White and Black Kingdoms. It won't be immediately clear who is really trustworthy. The boundaries between good and evil, magic and technology, and black and white will begin to blur, and the fate of the two kingdoms - and your son's life - will be in your hands.

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs.

is a brand-new title from the creators of This War of Mine. It’s a society survival game that asks what people are capable of when pushed to the brink of extinction. In an entirely frozen world, people develop steam-powered technology to oppose the overwhelming cold. The city’s ruler has to manage both the citizens and the infrastructure they live in. The leader’s tactical skills face challenges that will frequently question morality and the basic foundations of what we consider organized society. Optimization and resource management often clash with empathy and thoughtful decision-making. While city and society management will consume most of the ruler’s time, at some point exploration of the outside world is necessary to understand its history and present state.\r\n\r\nWhat decisions will you make to ensure the survival of your society? What will you do when pushed to the limit? And...\r\n\r\n...who will you become in the process?\r\n\r\nMAKE THE LAW\r\nSociety is a group of people who abide by the same rules and share similar beliefs. Establish laws that regulate the existence of your growing society. Decide on their working routine, healthcare, food provision and other crucial aspects of everyday life. Maintain their hope and contentment – the moral condition of your society is as important as securing the basic means to keep them fed and safe.\r\n\r\nWEIGH UP YOUR CHOICES\r\nSome of your decisions will seem small – like deciding the fate of a troubled citizen or meeting the demands of a newborn faction – but be aware that the sum of your doings can lead to unexpected results. Your people put their faith in you, but their devotion is not limitless. Leadership can be a burden.\r\n\r\nDEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES\r\nSurvival demands progress. React to current events, but don’t forget about the long term and investing in development and technological progress. Providing a highly advanced infrastructure with self-powered automatons, airships and other technical wonders is difficult, but achievable. It all depends on your management and leadership skills.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE FROSTLAND\r\nWhile New London is your main focus, there is much more to the world than what lies within the limits of your city. Expeditions, while risky, can bring you valuable intel, precious supplies and grow your society’s population. There may be people out there, and their fate lies solely in your hands.\r\n\r\nSHAPE YOUR SOCIETY\r\nIf you reach a turning point, do not hesitate to determine the path of your people. Should you rule them with an iron fist... or show them a way of compassion and faith? Reach for extremes or try to find a fair balance. Whichever you choose, remember: there’s no turning back.\r\n\r\nGO BEYOND THE CAMPAIGN\r\nThe main story campaign can go different ways depending on your playstyle, but it is still not the only challenge to tackle. Frostpunk offers different scenarios and additional updates with new content will be added in the future.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NSGBJ8CZCVC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Farm Frenzy Town Simulator","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38734.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.c0c2a283-7bf9-44bc-b14b-195bbf49bf91","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10684.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.08d92471-ba66-490c-9cdc-ae52b1236d47","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.43513.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.83f844b2-3b3d-46b1-8425-a7e41084a256","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50750.14364225526325356.cc1c0b4c-30b3-491f-a924-9681b69511cb.488ca65d-6d56-4d3b-b6a7-79843317f52f","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#333333","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.69","Price":1.69,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["30299ZJC.FarmHayDayTownship_rcfkh73117q02"],"ContentIds":["2734177e-4978-1d87-3beb-9472c6e22c0a","4f51484a-e083-76e9-b4a0-a42b2d870345"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A legendary game about farming. \r\n\r\nExplore fascinating farm, start playing, move to a country and learn how to manage a farm in a real fury. \r\n\r\nGrow plants, feed animals, grab laid eggs and follow instructions.

Join our big submarine patrol team. Be on our submarine! \r\n\r\nLegend says: The year was 1982. Argentina invaded the Falklands and other British territories in the South Atlantic. The British sent an expeditionary force to retake the islands. \r\n\r\nIn Submarine Patrol, you will relive this era as a leader of a submarine that patrols the islands and destroys enemy battleships.   \r\n\r\nTarget well before you shoot! Remember, you have a limited number of torpedoes on board. You cannot immediately fire one torpedo after another. \r\n\r\nIt takes 2-3 seconds to prepare the next torpedo. Injured ships, depending on the amount of damage, may reduce their speed and move slower. \r\n\r\nDepending on the ship type, you can hit it 1 to 4 times before it is completely destroyed. You have 10 levels to complete. If you do well you will be promoted to commander, captain, or even an admiral. The quality of shooting is determined by your score. You score with every successful shot and you are fined with every missed torpedo.  \r\n\r\nPlease, check our website for tips and tricks on the game here: http://pepper-games.com","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDFKK5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Brain App - Daily Brain Training on your PC","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44784.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.9032108b-fad1-49bb-be5c-664a724d71b4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30343.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.0079f5bd-2819-4253-b985-fc473cce3b1d","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57360.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.72c14d97-5304-414d-9174-c794be6ce172","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.29578.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.9756c217-352d-4d96-ab17-feaa61a348e3","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.32625.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.8d079710-f0ee-41e9-ac79-795baa1ed97a","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52865.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.e23dec78-1224-4abf-8e89-8822c63fe317","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41815.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.53beb30d-59a7-4df2-9392-a4f23aa9c8f7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30771.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.d0c5c056-3d27-4029-b8c6-c4eb8b45f4ae","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58276.9007199266285080.3928e998-020a-492b-a0f5-c8caa9f4b35d.1b06bd86-ab44-4fe1-846e-957c96609a27","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FE9102","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"£1.79","Price":1.79,"AverageRating":4.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["37580ChrisMayer.BrainApp_vq2vfetsejww2"],"ContentIds":["4a97531f-2eb8-d7af-6db7-30d97f411dac","c414b0cb-bd48-54b3-25aa-819609d349a9"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"WELCOME TO BRAIN APP!\r\n\r\nJoin the thousands of players who give their brains a daily workout with Brain App's fun and unique pick-up-and-play mental exercises.\r\n\r\nFeaturing seven exercises types to practice at your convenience - you can choose to exercise in 30 second, 45 second, or 60 second bursts.
