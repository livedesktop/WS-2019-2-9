One of the Microsoft developers noticed this version and implemented a version for Windows. It was first included with Win32s as an application that enabled the testing of the 32-bit thunking layer (does anyone remember what that was?). FreeCell remained relatively obscure until it was released as part of Windows 95. \r\nSince then the game has been ported to numerous platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We largely tried to recreate a full experience of the game in a tiny download package, including power moves, hints and undo (top right corner of the title bar). But there are also some minor twists to make it easier to play on a small factor mobile devices. In particular you don't have to select a card to move - drag and drop entire column - only appropriate cards will move, the rest will snap back. The cards will be moved to foundation automatically when possible. The scoring is also changed - only number of moves counted - the lower the score - the better. \r\n\r\nOnly the top (exposed) card of each tableau pile is available for play. It may be moved to a foundation pile, a free cell, or to another tableau pile. Within the tableau, cards are built down in sequence and alternating in color. Any card may be moved into an empty space. Blocks of cards may not be moved, unless the requisite number of free cells and/or tableau spaces are available to allow each individual card to be moved. To move part of partial pile, drag whole pile - the game will self adjust. If you fill all four foundation piles, you win. \r\nIf you don't see any more moves try hints, undo (top right corner) to back track, or menu to start new game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJCFP","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Games Logo Quiz","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2470.9007199266251536.3e975113-070f-4e76-af66-34fcd440399d.23c1b1a4-bfe3-44dc-83f0-3692e2e5a8f8","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28055.9007199266251536.0d266873-4627-43dc-80e1-8810c569c8c8.af4724e2-7d76-454d-980f-050aafd06f76","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Gratis⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["58942ScreechStudios.GamesLogoQuiz_zyer19rdd208m"],"ContentIds":["e93477c7-3555-e6db-088a-7181bbb563a1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A spin off of the classic Logo Quiz, Games Logo Quiz features some the best video games of all time.

Each stack must start with an Ace, followed by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen and end with a King.\r\n✓ At the beginning of the game, all the cards are dealt into 8 columns. At the top of the screen you will find 4 free cells and 4 foundations. Use the free cells to temporarily store one card at a time during the game.\r\n✓ Once you place a card in the foundation you cannot take it back. Make sure you no longer need it before placing it there.\r\n✓ You can move a card from one column to another if the top card from the other column is +1 higher and is of a different color. For example, you can put a 3 of hearts over a 4 of spades. Or you can put a 10 of clubs over a Jack of diamonds.\r\n✓ You can move an entire series of cards if you have enough free positions. Empty columns and empty free cells are considered free positions. The series of cards must be smaller or equal than the number of free positions plus 1. For example, if you have 2 empty free cells and one empty column you can move at most 4 cards at a time.\r\n✓ If you cannot move a stack because it is too large you can try splitting it into two parts. Then you can reassemble it in a new column.\r\n\r\n\r\n★ Support and Feedback\r\nIf you have any technical problems, please email us directly at support@gsoftteam.com.

Animations are fixed at 60 frames per second.\r\nNetwork communication uses non-blocking TCP sockets using select pooling for high throughput, allowing the app to resume games while the client changes IP addresses. You will almost find a lot at least 70 players connected to the server. As time passes, it will replace FIBS by creating multiple clients on different devices (desktop, phones, smart TVs).\r\n\r\nThe user interface is now highly optimized for speed and for saving your battery.\r\n\r\nManual rolls. Unique feature for those of you that think the dices are not random:\r\nThe formula explains by itself:\r\n   dice = 1 + (millis mod 6)\r\nMillis change 1000 times per second. Mod is the division reminder.\r\nWhen you click / touch the screen, it's up to you to get a better dice.\r\nYou can roll fo the computer as well.\r\n\r\nAfraid to install it?
