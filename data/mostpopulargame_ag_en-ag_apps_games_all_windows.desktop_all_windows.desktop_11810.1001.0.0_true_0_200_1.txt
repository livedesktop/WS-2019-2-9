The killer whale is in a ferocious mood. The thrill of controlling a fierce angry whale is unmatchable. Angry whale simulator 2016 is a super animal simulator and gives you a chance to watch and simulate a killer whale attack in deep sea and on the beach. So dive into the ocean and be a part of this adventure as an Angry Whale as this orca knows no stopping.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal simulators give you the opportunity to observe the wildlife and sea animal life from a close perspective. Angry Whale Simulator 2016 will give you that chance of controlling a whale that attacks and eat underwater animals and humans alike. The Orca whale experience is better than the shark jaws or piranha. Whales are huge animals that can stay both in deep and shallow waters and once they come close to surface, can run havoc on the beach and the boats.

going for a run and not much else. They prosper and reach their milestones that way. One heroic hamster tired of idleness decided there is more to life and idle than just that. Instead of going through the idle games routine of an ordinary rodent, he tapped and gathered like-minded hamsters for a trip of their lifetimes to reach his milestones - gather energy riches. He took some picks and built a high-tech spaceship powered by his tapped click wheel and prepared for a journey to explore the vast riches of the outer space void. All he needs before the takeoff to the void is your click.\r\n\r\nYour duty and milestones in this incremental game are to make sure that the brave heroic hamster picks do not revert to his idling ways and the eager astronaut would prosper by tapping him or his wheel with power click encouraging him to generate energy riches milestones and delve ever deeper into unexplored universe void. \r\n\r\nIn Hamster Universe like in idle games you have to spend the click generated energy for items of clothing appropriate for a heroic space voyager this eager hamster is (after all, you don’t want the first space hamster traveling dressed in some old rags, do you?). While the amount of tapped energy the astronaut hamster can generate by running is truly astounding, you can add to it by spending a part of the energy yield on alternate sources of picks which will keep the energy flowing even when the eager hamster picks are resting. If you want to generate even more, the hamster will always have some rewarding tasks and milestones to do. Fulfill them and you shall see the energy level riches skyrocket and your little astronaut hamster prosper.\r\n\r\nThe thought of idleness flying through the incremental / idle space with nothing but void around makes you feel uncomfortable? Don't worry! You shall not be joining a crew of a single spaceship. In fact, your eager tapped friend picks a whole fleet of heroic hamster-piloted spacecraft in support!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n• Idle games / Incremental gameplay is easy to understand for everyone! Click this cute astronaut to generate energy riches.\r\n• Is hamster tired of being tapped? Let your eager heroic astronaut prosper in the void even when you’re on idleness duty!\r\n• Spend tapped energy for powerful incremental upgrades to reach your milestones.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarn in-game XBOX achievements to prove your awesomeness.\r\n\r\nCheck out http://gametroopers.net for more games about to be released!\r\n\r\n** PLEASE NOTE: \"Hamster Universe\" is completely free to play but has optional in-game purchases.

A game is won by the first partnership to score 100 or more points in successful contracts.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago Bridge you play four hands of Bridge.

Separated into a set of districts, each with its own look and real feel. Prepare for heart-stopping and breathtaking thrills you have never seen in mobile games before.\r\n\r\nRIDE EPIC BIKES\r\nRace on a huge selection of easily customizable motorcycles ranging from badass choppers to fast motocross bikes. All prepped up, loaded with nitro and ready to unleash their full fury on the asphalt below.\r\nThere’s also a treat for all of the dirt fanatics out there - you can drive real quads. Experience speed that cannot be stopped by anything less than a brick wall!\r\n\r\nCHALLENGE THE BIGGEST AND THE BADDEST\r\nFeel the adrenaline overload as you start racing against the biker gangs that rule The City. They are the famous 1%, the outlaw bike racers who thrive on crime and their need for the rush of speed. They believe that all of the best things in the world are for free (when you take them forcibly) and that having fun in life is the only thing that matters. Except for power and money, of course.\r\n\r\nEXPRESS YOURSELF\r\nCustomize your bike with unique tuning - slap some decals and paint it with your favourite color. Go crazy with the combinations, it’s your ride - your rules. In illegal drag racing competitions being creative about your bike is the only way to become known and respected.\r\n\r\nEXPLORE THE URBAN SPRAWL\r\nThe City is split into districts, each run by a different bike gang. You’ll have to beat all of the renegade bikers if you hope to assume direct control over The City. Race in a deep selection of realistic game modes and challenges.\r\n\r\nBECOME A LEGEND OF THE ROAD\r\nThe great highway awaits for those brave enough to compete with the best racing competitors in the world of underground bike community. You have to be hardcore to keep up with the criminal kings of the road - but the prize for the best moto racer is really big. Do you think you can become the new bike gang leader of The City?\r\n\r\nEASY RIDER\r\nThis bike racing game is optimized to work smooth on most devices. Additionally it was translated into 17 languages from all over the world.

How? You blow at them with more bubbles, and when three or more of the same color come together, they all explode. Just tap at where you want the next bubble to go.\r\nThe more bubbles blow up at one tap, the increasingly more points you gain (six ones at one tap is better tan two three-bubble taps). Besides, those bubbles that fell apart from the rest will explode too. It is well worth trying to arrange such avalanches, as they will give you ten times more points than ordinary bursts.\r\nAnother important rule to know is that the borders are like mirrors. If you shoot a bubble towards an exposed border, it will not stick to the border but will bounce right back like a stream of light against a mirror. This feature becomes really handful when the center of your board is filled up with and you need to shoot some bubbles on the sidebars.\r\nIf your tap fails to detonate any bubbles, you get a foul, and when there are several fouls, one or two new line of bubbles appears at the top. The number of misfires allowed before bubbles will advance again, is shown by the number of silver ball in the left bottom corner.\r\nThe game is over when you clean all the bubbles off and your score doubles, or bubbles move all the way down on you.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9P3DXSG7H78L","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toon Crush : The Block Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5858.14543889220449585.4bdafbb2-da9a-484a-b04d-dc6480b0fd3f.a2ab45d5-3805-4a0f-9e2c-266f954bb369","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61398.14543889220449585.4bdafbb2-da9a-484a-b04d-dc6480b0fd3f.6bf9c33c-0a0e-480a-a093-ec05b9f6db21","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14927.14543889220449585.5186e02c-cccd-4936-8e2f-86ee73380fd2.2785594e-833e-4e87-9f46-4541fd5621aa","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["55026QueenGames.ToonBlastOfficialGame_fd557p673vg74"],"ContentIds":["0c30c7c3-db2e-fbfc-3531-55c86ac5e443","590c6add-5870-3e76-8062-c56b7c287589","1480d385-7e57-207b-1f82-eeb724e6f824"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Match 2 or more cubes of the same color to solve puzzles and clear levels.

A drift is when a driver performs a controlled slide through corners while adhering to the racing line. Drifting involves fast cars, super skilled drivers and hardcore fans.\r\n\r\nIt’s a combination of driving skill, style and showmanship. It’s all about loss of the rear wheel traction while keeping the race car in total control. Drifting is so popular because it brings all the best aspects of motor sports into one package. Highly skilled drivers control a high powered street car past its limit, sideways at high speed, burning rubber. It can’t get any better!\r\n____________________________________\r\n\r\nSUPPORT: http://en.ratrodstudio.com/support/ \r\nVISIT US: http://ratrodstudio.com\r\nFOLLOW US: twitter.com/ratrodstudio","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NNQ3K4W9Z4F","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Town City -

So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

CITY. EVER.\r\n- Craft hundreds of unique, gorgeous buildings in your city and expand it from a tiny, peaceful town to a big, bustling metropolis.\r\n- Don’t forget to decorate your skyline by building famous landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, the Tower of London or the Tower of Pisa (there’s something for every tower fan) to elevate your city to the top tourist destinations.\r\n\r\nMeet your new family \r\n- Cartoon fans rejoice! Meet and collect tons of funny characters with their own unique personalities, like the portly Sergeant Cakemore, or the uber-macho builder guy, Forest Manly (whose real skill is the tiny bit too suggestive eyebrow raise).\r\n- Build a water tower. Check! Build a fire station. Check! But who’s going to drive the fire truck? Assigning citizens to jobs will help you optimize your city, but you can go even further! Send them on missions and they won’t come home empty handed or do favors for them so they would invite their friends too to fill your city!\r\n\r\nFusion is the way to go\r\n- The future: age of smart forks, exploding hover boards, even selfies! But now the 21st century lives up to its promise, with the ability to merge buildings into advanced skyscrapers and unlock specializations.\r\n- Unlocking each allows you to develop your city towards different directions and expand your collection with specialized buildings such as Sustainability, Commerce, Education and Entertainment. Choose which one suits your strategy best!\r\n\r\nThe grass is always greener…\r\n- But is it really? Find out by visiting the cities of your friends. Is your friend the best builder you know? Well, you can always “borrow” a bit of their ideas to improve your game … sshhh, we won’t tell anyone…\r\n- In case you find yourself short on some crucial resources, visiting the Trade HQ should be a major part of your strategy, it is where you can collect some extra cash or find missing upgrade items.\r\n\r\n\r\n**** Game not optimized for Nokia 2520.\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\n\r\nVisit our official site at http://gmlft.co/website_EN\r\nCheck out the new blog at http://gmlft.co/central\r\n\r\nDon't forget to follow us on social media:\r\nFacebook: http://gmlft.co/SNS_FB_EN\r\nTwitter: http://gmlft.co/SNS_TW_EN\r\nInstagram: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_IG\r\nYouTube: http://gmlft.co/GL_SNS_YT\r\n\r\nThis app allows you to purchase virtual items within the app and may contain third party advertisements that may redirect you to a third party site.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Policy: http://www.gameloft.com/en/privacy-notice\r\nTerms of Use: http://www.gameloft.com/en/conditions-of-use\r\nEnd-User License Agreement: http://www.gameloft.com/en/eula","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NC7XD5B1NL0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fashion Hair Salon 2","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53868.13568673204378755.6eba7771-b09b-4625-a403-4695bfddc653.d458c9cf-9c80-4b05-ac56-5b62413c24fb","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62720.13568673204378755.6eba7771-b09b-4625-a403-4695bfddc653.f00c500a-96ec-4004-8f61-cd7d59fac134","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#464646","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["35237JoyJourney.PrincessFashionHairSalonMakeupDres_rqmgvvvsy2kse"],"ContentIds":["f11a805d-6209-81cb-109c-9fbe456c8bbc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Now you are a designer, please help princess design their hair styles.More interesting & funny! \r\nIn this game, we have 4 modes: Hair Salon Task Mode, Free Design Mode, Dressing Room, Color Lab.
