Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call &quot;Solitaire.&quot; Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of &quot;Classic&quot; to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Either way, be ready to encounter all new bloon waves and special bloon attack patterns like Cash Starve or Fast and Furious.\r\n\r\nREINFORCE YOUR FRIENDS\r\nConnect with Facebook friends, then help each other win and expand. Send Supply Crates back and forth for bonus starting cash. Visit friends' cities to check out their strategies and their city design skills, and while you're there root out any bloon spies to win a reward for both you and your friend.\r\n\r\nSHOW OFF YOUR SKILLS\r\nBuild up the strongest lineup of monkey towers possible and compete with other players for the best score in weekly Contested Territory events. Use the latest in monkey science to send player vs. player bloon attacks, then see whose defenses are the strongest and earn extra rewards for victory.\r\n\r\nDownload for free and play Bloons Monkey City now!\r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\nBloons Monkey City is free to download and play (aside from internet, carrier, data, device, and other services for which the player is financially responsible), but some in-game items can be purchased with real money.

Grave after grave... I couldn't bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child's burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target's face as the blood drained from his body. But it this was war, and the law of a good soldier was a lack of feeling. Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.\r\n\r\n**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** \r\nLaunch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.
