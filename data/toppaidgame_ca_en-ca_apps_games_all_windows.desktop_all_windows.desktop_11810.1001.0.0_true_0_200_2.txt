Your kids can hand Tommy a skateboard to make him go faster as they become comfortable with blending the sounds.\r\n\r\n- With Skateboards and Helmets children practice reading as they are asked to fit Tommy's animal friends with skateboards and helmets.\r\n\r\n- In Turn the Blocks kids make words in a way that's fun by turning real-looking blocks with letters on each side until the word is spelled out.\r\n\r\n- Through Word Ball children learn to identify spoken words by helping Tommy bat the right ball.\r\n\r\n- With Word Magic kids learn about word families as they fill the corresponding pot with potion and watch magic happen\r\n\r\n- In Rocket Words children get to practice word families as they assemble and launch a rocket into space\r\n\r\nIf your children do not know the alphabet sounds yet, we recommend our Kids ABC Phonics app. And if your kids need to learn or practice the names of the letters, try our Kids ABC Letters app.\r\n\r\nEvery section is designed to let children enjoy success time after time and receive positive reinforcement from the likable teacher, so they want to keep learning. Once your child is involved and happy, you can relax, with the assurance that he or she is having a great time - and learning.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDSHTX","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Human World for Kids, Educational Games for Babies","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.10552.9007199266578625.1d9707e6-fff4-4593-b6ee-9044142f0f6f.48267ff8-857b-4783-99fc-471e2dc3746e","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.57517.9007199266578625.3c837e09-d8c8-468c-a788-cb7672d690b6.0ae1d6ca-c818-4ec2-a524-90ab790713c6","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22466.9007199266578625.e0d7908c-3e6e-4e25-aaa7-b0b013dee5ab.cfb8fc65-e913-4f85-ba0d-16b753752dba","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31005.9007199266578625.02b05bda-129f-4d35-ba61-53d313d90ce7.9c7d7a46-3eb4-4b61-bb65-6c85f76787eb","Height":558,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52020.9007199266578625.03d21905-2084-4c01-b8b3-336d2d759f0b.8f765b47-621b-49b8-bd6c-f95c8dfc5c1f","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.44584.9007199266578625.8afeb8b9-fc10-4916-8b74-39840210cb02.1f200068-ca43-497d-8bb9-bd1feca5e303","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.4271.9007199266578625.fd3f7df4-fd36-43d9-ba45-afbe6f3f8a04.1f726ad5-4c71-4a9d-9c1f-cea3c7267187","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#458ED7","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $2.49","Price":2.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32004CLEVERBIT.38968ADC83B27_krxe918j0j7ce"],"ContentIds":["74da01c8-7364-c0af-ee82-97078eaf42a1","5c0722b1-dfc4-cae0-da60-60a6884eea21","750d9e30-e72a-fe75-86ad-69452edd5776"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"“The Human World for Kids” - an educational game for children ages 2-4 from the series \"Kids Learn Words\".\r\n\r\nTogether with your child, look at bright, colorful flashcards from the \"human world\" accompanied by sounds, learn the names of these man-made objects, and listen to the sounds they make!\r\n\r\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she has learned. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \r\n\r\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\r\n\r\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH40DCM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Thimbleweed Park","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25969.13510798887970570.32321efe-b9e1-4e2b-a381-00abe742e4f8.b639bfa6-5206-4b31-b073-ff33589087cf","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.55381.13510798887970570.332df06a-dba4-413b-9eab-5d5dd937caec.9d287e23-dc32-41eb-bcf7-a1bc66795c0c","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28374.13510798887970570.356d52d2-afd5-404f-9810-d138f625715c.a20c59da-4fde-4e93-9a85-c00d6821f56b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42545.13510798887970570.ac407564-8ae0-46d0-9a71-80d0e1420d1c.8c18910b-9386-4857-bef0-f582a97c959f","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $25.99","Price":25.99,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["TerribleToybox.ThimbleweedPark_1gqq6c01ymkxp"],"ContentIds":["577511ba-0854-bb72-499b-ae3f43e5a91c","d5518e3a-5886-068c-9224-58bfcab58787","b3a637b7-b834-4482-9c58-d04a0e61abbc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to Thimbleweed Park.

on the face of the planet. These amazing animals boggle our imagination by their variety and size. Some were small like modern lizards, others as huge as a multi-storey building. Some were predators, for example the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, while others were herbivorous - like the Diplodocus, Ankylosaurus and Iguanodon. Some species could fly, some lived in water, but most of them walked on the ancient land. Dinosaurs lived in the Mesozoic era, which is subdivided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous. Today, archaeologists study the remains of these animals and can only assume how they looked and lived.  \n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

The higher the level, the greater the reward\r\n- multilingual interface\r\n- original panoramic sound and music\r\n- additional DLC maps and campaigns with new enemies and towers\r\n- online worldwide leaderboards\r\n\r\nWe hope that Light Forces commanders, who loved the first part of Myth Defense, will be pleasantly surprised by the innovations in this part:\r\n• Enemies are now divided into classes: Live, Machine and Magic. Some towers affects only units of one class.\r\n• Moving platforms on the battlefield where you can build towers. Platform with a tower will move as close as possible to enemy units and attack them.\r\n• Some units (Dwarf and Paladin) wear armor. Armor absorbs 80% of low physical damage. Armor threshold is shown in the unit description which you can see by tapping on an enemy unit on the field. If tower causes more physical damage than the armor threshold, the armor breaks down and the unit gets full damage value. Armor doesn't protect units from other types of damage (fire , magic, etc)\r\n• Several fundamentally new towers:\r\n  - Fear Tower: scares enemy units, forcing them to run away from the tower for a while. One enemy can be scared only once (though some units are fearless).\r\n  - Cursed Tower: normally it shoots causing a base damage but can be charged with coins to temporarily multiply its power. If the health of the enemy unit does not exceed the base damage, the tower will kill it without spending extra-points. If the unit is strong tower will try to kill it, spending no more than enough extra-points.\r\n  - Jet Mace: shoots with a large spiked ball horizontally or vertically. It strikes several enemy units losing some destructive power each time. The ball continues to fly until it loses all the energy.\r\n  - Radioactive towers (Uranium and Plutonium): do not shoot, but continuously irradiates all units within damage radius. Golems and infected (by Plague or Poison Spider Tower) units are vulnerable to radiation.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFHW7P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"ilomilo plus","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.34626.9007199266247148.8663112b-2f68-4d84-a779-cca0f08defad.14ede7cf-b7e5-406f-aa6d-a4a5ad7f71dc","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#8F0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42549.9007199266247148.b090e22c-d5b9-48c0-a2f6-efe851ee1c3c.5d859463-5081-48cb-aeed-e16edf917f25","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#8F0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":3.9,"RatingsCount":"61","PackageFamilyNames":["Microsoft.Ilomilo_8wekyb3d8bbwe"],"ContentIds":["274850ab-5b2c-7663-f4fa-0bb42020798f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"ilomilo plus is the Windows 8 version of the XBLA title, ilomilo, beefed up with additional fun levels, two exciting new chapters and three new challenging cubes. ilomilo is a puzzle game where the player controls two fellows named ilo and milo.

Their first book of fairytales that was published back in 1812 included about 200 fairy tales making those brothers one of the most famous storytellers of folk tales, which made stories like 'Cinderella', 'The Frog Prince', 'Hansel and Gretel', 'Rapunzel', Sleeping Beauty' and 'Snow White' to be well-known all around the world. Even though it is known that those tales are collected, there are numerous discussions about the ideology behind those tales sometimes being criticized for the certain note of violence and crudity that appears in some of the stories while others debate about the possibility of including real situations when the brothers were editing those stories.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are philologists that work in one of the most interesting clubs in the world. They have job as many of us would dream of. Namely this time they got a task to discover if the brothers Grimm's fairytales are based on true stories or they are simply part of someone's fantasy, no matter if brothers Grimm's or the fantasy of the folk storyteller, taken in general.\r\n\r\nDoris and Ralph are at the moment in the land where they hope that was the land where actually happened the story about Snow White and the seven dwarfs. Denis and Ralph enter into this adventure being objective, without any expectations and that's why they would be very surprised by the objects they will find there.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9PBMHT7R51D3","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asdivine Hearts","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18405.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.54ba0935-7426-4347-9eec-bfab2fb86fb1","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17550.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.95ac9da1-c027-4c2c-bdfb-699fa4f6792e","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.56628.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.9803f420-359e-4041-8690-7ae6893509cf","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30816.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.6938dd22-d3ba-4310-a48e-eeb335bc1231","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.21569.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.dcedb563-1185-43c4-918b-ea7e959d712f","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47660.14120668810497520.4b884d5a-a668-426a-b619-42972dbfc947.24b9d568-5898-4a3b-897f-c297b8ea5369","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $18.99","Price":18.99,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["KEMCO.AsdivineHearts_f2bp5vqmgh7cp"],"ContentIds":["68edfd91-e5df-498d-b6f6-afdc8b005921","09888760-7399-b55d-ad82-7afe03361a1d"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Travel alongside four companions and a cat in a fantasy RPG featuring stunning animated turn-based battles!\r\n\r\nOne year ago, the world of Asdivine was enveloped by a brilliant flash of light.

It is a detective story rich with horror, plot twists, and shadowy intrigue.\r\n\r\nA year has passed since the events of Maple Creek. But for the past few months, our detective has been hot on the trail of the demonic preacher she fought one year ago. Yet he has managed to always stay one step ahead. \r\n\r\nShe hoped to bring an end to the chase in the redwood forests of Northern California. But like so many times before, the trail went cold… \r\n\r\nThen she encountered an abandoned camper in the middle of the highway. Enormous claw marks scored the roof and the lost family’s personal belongings were scattered everywhere. All signs pointed to the scene being fresh. \r\n\r\nAnd all clues led into nearby Ravenwood Park…\r\n\r\nWalking through the park gates, the detective feels the weight of invisible eyes watching.

With huge excitement, boys and girls decorate the Christmas tree, make sweets, deck out the house and look forward to their presents. These coloring pages depict your favorite Christmas characters and the main symbols of the festive season. The coloring process gives every kid the feeling of the Christmas holidays drawing near.\r\n\r\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\r\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\r\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\r\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\r\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.

Happy retro gaming!\r\n\r\nRocky Horror, The Fruit Machine can be played by touching the onscreen buttons (Or the corner game board icons, a real help for smaller screens) or by using a mouse-which covers most devices so happy retro gaming, all you need to provide is some real luck...\r\n\r\nTo add coins/credits to the fruit machine simply tap or click the red coin slot (Coin slot found at the top right of the fruit machine). Each tap/click of the coin slot will add four credits to the fruit machine, then just play the fruit machine like you normally would do. \r\n\r\nThe main features of Rocky Horror, The Fruit Machine include;\r\n\r\n-Trail Mystery Bonus Features-(When the trail is on number four you can select a random trail mystery bonus feature which may help you to either get a prize win or increase the trail number you are currently on, depending on the feature and most of the time they are a real help to the player. The mystery bonus features available include Random Rocket, Showskill, 3 Shot, Nudge, etc ...).\r\n\r\n-Trail Nudges, Nudge Gamble, Nudge Buster-(Trail nudges can be offered as a trail mystery bonus feature and are also offered randomly whilst playing the trail part of the fruit machine. When trail nudges are offered they are sometimes offered with a nudge gamble too and when you have trail nudges available you may use the nudge buster button to move all of the three main reels down one position at the cost of just one nudge, a real useful button indeed).\r\n\r\n-Hi-Lo Gamble-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you will be offered an optional prize/trail hi-lo gamble. Here you can either collect your prize, gamble with a hi-lo or possibly exchange to the game board if available. If you gamble and lose, you will lose the gambled prize/trail, if you gamble and win though you will improve your prize/trail by one position/slot and if you have an exchange to game board offer, then that offer may improve too. If you are lucky and get to the top of the prize/trail board you will automatically win the trail jackpot repeater).\r\n\r\n-Exchange To Game Board-(When you get a prize win on the fruit machine or the trail number is nine or more, you may be offered an exchange to the game board. An exchange to the game board is offered when the tubes are lit in the tube slot next to the prize/trail amount you are currently on. When offered an exchange to game board amount, it will mirror the prize/trail slot you are currently on, the higher the slot, the better the game board exchange offer. The exchange offer may improve every time a hi-lo gamble is won, except on a trail jackpot repeater win).\r\n\r\n-Game Board/Tubes-(Once exchanged to the game board you can gamble and spin to try to add to or light up/activate the tubes or collect a tube if it’s active. The tubes consist of a cash tube, a grab tube, a nudge tube and a features tube which all offer different games and the higher the tube, the better. To select an active/lit up tube you can either press its corresponding button or press the corresponding corner icon on the game board. If any of the tubes reach the tube jackpot repeater slot you will automatically start the tube jackpot repeater game).\r\n\r\nThere are many more features like the board mystery bonus games, tile games, tube games/features, holds, trail holds, real fun and too many to list and explain in detail. The game also has retro sound effects, all in all, a lot of real retro fun in one retro fruit machine-happy retro gaming!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NKK0VQ0N17D","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Building Destoyer - Drive and Crash","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15354.13659878786850277.eb77e15e-a67f-475a-9a44-e46068d6c336.8461a30d-b00f-48b8-a5d4-345412ac65df","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1344.13659878786850277.eb77e15e-a67f-475a-9a44-e46068d6c336.8b194782-2bd3-477e-a9fa-2a9e7170958c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.64622.13659878786850277.eb77e15e-a67f-475a-9a44-e46068d6c336.3d99117c-0073-4299-af94-44bd6b69f64b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["SimulatorsLiveLLC.BuildingDestoyer-DriveandCrash_4m7mw7nsxfatr"],"ContentIds":["1ef43c95-c8f1-33f8-d8d2-bb9acd273649","c5293637-3bf2-ab21-c96a-988b2e482e15"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"To destroy is easier than to create!

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDKKDR","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"SimplePhysics","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41562.9007199266524604.1f674152-4630-4546-9bed-1b257f1f0c6a.d572fc45-933f-4d29-9934-de0445394d96","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#222222","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $1.89","Price":1.89,"AverageRating":2.8,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["38469JundrooLLC.SimplePhysics_ptjf449mzfh6e"],"ContentIds":["0a4ba3f7-8217-fb8a-e7f2-3dc2caa699a1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"SimplePhysics lets you design complex structures for everything from tree houses to ferris wheels to submarines and then simulates your design with a sophisticated physics engine. \r\n\r\nA wise person once said: \"An engineer is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.\" In SimplePhysics, your design must not only be strong enough, it must be cheap enough to win. \r\n\r\nCreate your design in seconds with the blueprints editor.

Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\r\n\r\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \r\n\r\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \r\n\r\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \r\n\r\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \r\n\r\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \r\n\r\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \r\n\r\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\r\n\r\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction.
