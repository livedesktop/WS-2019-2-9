Test your skills in Quick Trivia-Harry Potter through four different levels  (easy, medium, hard, and INSANE) to see how you hold up. Compete against users from all across the world to make it into the top ten. Don’t waste time though because the quicker you answer, the more points you get! One second could make the difference between bragging about being in the top ten and wishing you were.  Also, the more difficult level you choose the more points you earn!  You can purchase the INSANE level, which will earn you the most amount of points per question. With over 75 questions in easy, medium, hard and 50 questions in insane, you will rarely see the same question twice!\r\n\r\nWant to be able to influence the game?  Take advantage of the built in ability to submit potential trivia questions.  These questions will be reviewed and potentially added to the game every couple of weeks in a new update!

Ambulance rescue driver is an emergency simulation game where you can be the hero and save the day.\r\n\r\nYou have to drive an ambulance and attend to emergency situations. You are the on-duty ambulance emergency driver who needs to attend to the emergency call on the situation and take injured people to hospital ER for medical treatment. The lives of those people depend on you so you need to reach the accident scene and save lives. Drive fast and safe to transport them to a hospital emergency room while the ambulance doctor provides first aid treatment on the way. Driving, parking and transporting are all part of your duties as an ambulance rescue driver. Don’t forget to turn the ambulance sirens on so that people make way for you to be able to successfully complete your rescue mission.\r\n\r\nDriving an ambulance is not an easy task as you always have to drive safe and also have to reach the hospital in time. The situation is serious and people are injured. Make sure you drive straight and don’t crash into buildings as that will stop you from reaching the hospital in time and can also be fatal for the patients.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

10!\r\n\r\nSolitaire remains the most played computer game of all time, and for good reason. Simple rules and straightforward gameplay make it easy to pick up for everyone.\r\n\r\nSolitaire has been part of Windows for more than 25 years, and the Microsoft Solitaire Collection makes it the best experience to date with five different card games in one:\r\n\r\nKlondike\r\nThis version is the timeless classic that many people just call \"Solitaire.\" Try to clear all the cards from the table using one or three-card draw, while using traditional scoring or the Vegas scoring system.\r\n\r\nSpider\r\nEight columns of cards await your attempts to clear them with the fewest moves possible. Start out playing with a single suit until you’re comfortable, and then see how you fare when using two or even all four suits in a game.\r\n\r\nFreeCell\r\nUse four extra cells to move cards around as you try to clear all cards from the table. More strategic than the Klondike version, FreeCell rewards players who think several moves ahead.\r\n\r\nTriPeaks\r\nSelect cards in a sequence, either up or down, to earn points and clear the board. How many boards can you clear before you run out of deals?\r\n\r\nPyramid\r\nPair two cards that add up to 13 in order to remove them from the board. Try to reach the top of the pyramid. See how many boards you can clear and how high you can score in this highly addictive card game!\r\n\r\nDaily Challenges\r\nPlayers receive new challenges each day. Complete enough Daily Challenges in a month to earn badges and compete with your friends.\r\n\r\nStar Club\r\nEven more challenges arranged in collections and packs you can unlock by earning stars.\r\n\r\nChoose Your Theme\r\nThe Microsoft Solitaire Collection features several beautiful themes, from the simplicity of \"Classic\" to the serenity of an Aquarium that comes to life before you while you play. You can even create custom themes from your own photos!\r\n\r\nXbox Live Integration\r\nSign in with your Microsoft account to earn achievements, compete with your friends on the leaderboards, and track your personal gameplay statistics.

Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9MXLBB21F3XG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Block Wars Survival Games","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48565.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.83dc02e9-eb43-4863-92c8-cb9cd0aa1b32","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30795.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.ad247f41-b79f-4f95-a0fb-72fd911328fb","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58607.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.5cc55c34-734f-435e-8005-3a747d078606","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60681.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.bb57bc09-1cce-4426-a89a-6fde9e428df6","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28149.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.c45bb530-eed4-40f4-9e6c-9d77d303e88a","Height":465,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2188.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.242f4f0d-a240-4baa-bd0e-141fe4653764","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.50910.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.c7e07d78-3fca-4a55-a264-007e7d59f100","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2525.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.5251a80d-b5cf-41cd-9e2d-a29db7983096","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41254.13892599102333229.ee21897b-22f3-45d8-9bff-3d0efc471a64.13f8b19b-dee3-4a98-9590-3652ac4732c5","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AeriaCanadaStudioInc.BlockWarsSurvivalGames_a93qbadnxbjb4"],"ContentIds":["07adacba-8708-97be-b187-cdf5c9dd6a88","229808fb-9290-f97d-6334-e361a3b63733"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Prepare yourself for a battle unlike any other when you enter the world of Block Wars Survival Games!
