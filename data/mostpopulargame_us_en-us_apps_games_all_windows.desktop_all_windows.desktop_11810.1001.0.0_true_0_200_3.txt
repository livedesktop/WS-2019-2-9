Animations are fixed at 60 frames per second.\r\nNetwork communication uses non-blocking TCP sockets using select pooling for high throughput, allowing the app to resume games while the client changes IP addresses. You will almost find a lot at least 70 players connected to the server. As time passes, it will replace FIBS by creating multiple clients on different devices (desktop, phones, smart TVs).\r\n\r\nThe user interface is now highly optimized for speed and for saving your battery.\r\n\r\nManual rolls. Unique feature for those of you that think the dices are not random:\r\nThe formula explains by itself:\r\n   dice = 1 + (millis mod 6)\r\nMillis change 1000 times per second. Mod is the division reminder.\r\nWhen you click / touch the screen, it's up to you to get a better dice.\r\nYou can roll fo the computer as well.\r\n\r\nAfraid to install it? Give it a try directly in your browser at http://www.catalinux.eu/bg/em\r\nThe web build is still experimental and keyboard input on phones is not done yet.\r\n\r\nPlayers can watch running games in real-time.\r\nIn order to watch a game, go to Play Online -> Lobby -> Games -> Watch option next to the game.\r\nIn order to stop watching a game, click the Menu bar on top left of the application and select Leave option.\r\n\r\nAny player can double the match score any time while playing.\r\nThe score, pip count and the cube value is displayed on the top side.\r\nThe table can be reversed as the user is more used to.\r\nThe checker color can be changed from black to white.\r\nThe number of games can be assigned from 1 to 9 matches.\r\nThe sounds can be muted.\r\n\r\nIn auto-match mode the game request is sent to all the users that are not playing.\r\nIn friend mode it is possible to filter players by name (case sensitive mode), chat with them and request playing a game.\r\n\r\nGame timers are used to avoid too much waiting for opponent's move or double confirmation.\r\n\r\nTwo green arrows were added on the right side of the board in order to visualize current's player turn.\r\n\r\nChat support was also added, there players can talk to each other.\r\nUnicode characters are not supported.\r\n\r\nAvailable on Windows 10 and Android. \r\nPlanning on implementing it on Windows 8 and IOS... Play Backgammon Reloaded from anywhere with anyone. \r\n\r\nThere is a Reset button in the Menu options for panic mode. What this does to disconnect from the server and reset the board.\r\n\r\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyb0R71MxTk\r\n\r\nEnjoy

A run is a set of cards with numbers in a descending order and alternating colors.\r\n♣ If you ever get empty columns you can place a king or any run starting with a king.\r\n♣ When you run out of useful moves you can continue by tapping on the deck at the top left of the screen. You will draw 1 card or 3 cards depending on the type of the level. If there are no more cards in the deck tap on its outline to draw more cards from the beginning.\r\n♣ You should try to expose more and more cards as quickly as possible.

Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realize your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system!\r\n\r\nAvailable ingame: SlopeMania!\r\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes!

However, beware: it's not easy to win on the highest difficulty level!\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Randomly generated or predefined phase goals\r\n- Configurable number of players: 2-4\r\n- Configurable game difficulty: 1-10\r\n- Configurable game speed\r\n- Undo function\r\n- Clear UI design: NO music, NO irritating avatars!\r\n- No online login required\r\n\r\nObject:\r\nTo be the first player to complete all phases/contracts. In case of a tie, the player with the lowest score is the winner. A Joker card '*' may be used to replace a number card and can also be used as any color to complete any phase.\r\nSkip cards have only one purpose: to make another player lose their turn. To use it, give the card to the player you want to lose their turn.  \r\n\r\nRuns consist of 3 or more cards in numerical order. The cards do not have to be the same colors. Joker cards can be used to complete runs.\r\n\r\nSets consist of two or more cards of the same number. Sets can include numbers from any color.   \r\n\r\nGame Play:\r\nPlayers draw a card from either the deck or the top of the discard pile at the beginning of their turn. At the end of their turn, they must discard a single card.\r\n\r\nCompleting phases:\r\nWhen you are able to fully meet the requirements of the phase, you may complete it. Additionally, you may play extra cards as you play the phase if they fit into the phase. For example, if you completed phase  '2 sets of 3' you could play three 4’s and three 6’s. You could play additional fours or sixes as part of your sets, but you could not add a different set.\r\n\r\nHitting:\r\nAfter making a phase, players may “hit” onto other phases in play. The cards you add to the completed phases must fit into the phase, and you can only hit after your own phase is in play.\r\n\r\nEnding the round:\r\nPlayers end the round by playing all of the cards from their hand. The player who goes out first wins the hand and scores zero points. The rest of the players score points (points are bad). Players who completed their phase move on to the next phase. Any players who were unable to complete their phase during the round must attempt to complete it again during the next round.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NJ6W1T90Z1S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Eventide 3: Legacy of Legends","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37134.13686172165398333.8b77a51d-6227-4dd2-88b0-049be153d477.666b4f04-b999-4f6c-ac4d-4eabc414ec76","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18864.13686172165398333.8b77a51d-6227-4dd2-88b0-049be153d477.281d4fdb-53ef-4d8b-8eae-f78696b69f6c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24778.13686172165398333.336ae213-31a7-4fd8-a2ba-9e5119a4f2c8.84a28c65-da3a-496d-88b9-59e5adfc9ef9","Height":2160,"Width":2160,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62357.13686172165398333.0804d46d-ab29-49c1-8acd-f79b645a9cea.583c4950-ad8d-406b-a3da-de88d7a41a49","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"192","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.Eventide3LegacyofLegends_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["012635a3-7835-fff3-db26-a12e7322503e","b2efbb42-7793-4a8f-e9f3-a37cf7fd1296","ff2eee05-d164-2e51-d0d1-f16f1b3d8caa","6ae45a7c-873a-0758-532a-dfded2c58449"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Get this game at 40% off to celebrate the beginning of Chinese New year!\r\n\r\nFANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nStep into the shoes of Mary Gilbert - world renowned botanist and guardian of Fern Flower - to once again explore the mythical realm of Slavic fables.

As any other successful game, millions of Solitaire clones have been created on all possible platforms. So why should you give our version a try? We tried to recreate all the fun of original game with many card laouts in a tiny download package. \r\n\r\nThe game starts with a specific layout and one open card. Rest of the cards are on closed stack. Your aim is to move all the cards to open card. \r\n- You can move any of the open card on the three peaks to the open card if it is adjacent to it regardless of the suit. e.g. you can move a 3 or 5 in case the open card is 4. Either King or 2 can go on top of the Ace (and vice versa). \r\n- If you are unable to move any card you can open a close card. \r\n- Every time you move a card from layout to open card you get points. These points start with 1 for the first time and increase by 1 for subsequent cards. However if you open a close card the streak breaks and the point start from 1 again. Earn bonus points for left over closed cards or for fast finish.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N8Q24KJNTJ9","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Football Strike - Real Soccer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39517.14040736182586218.82d378a3-94a1-4a06-b260-d8d75ec08b1b.6e706705-5d05-4eae-b879-7a6bf06f925e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42970.14040736182586218.82d378a3-94a1-4a06-b260-d8d75ec08b1b.fa32f603-656a-45af-8bb9-a18793cc5af8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39517.14040736182586218.82d378a3-94a1-4a06-b260-d8d75ec08b1b.6e706705-5d05-4eae-b879-7a6bf06f925e","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"192","PackageFamilyNames":["41633NinjaBlitzWarGames.FootballStrike-RealSoccer_qnq5anfshaxke"],"ContentIds":["25609bd0-4f79-95f5-3c5e-985efb3a9ba7","bef64a1d-3d3b-ea69-e02b-ce2716399b79"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"You’ve never played a football game like this before.

It's hard to discover what makes rolling those dice over and over again so fun, but it's beyond delight when you finally see those sixes line up. \r\n\r\nYahtzee is a simple brain game that trains analytical thinking. It's a classic board dice game.\r\nThe objective of Yahtzee is to score the highest possible score within the 13 rounds of the game. Players roll five dice in order to make the desired combinations, which have different fixed or variable point values.

If the player can play all five cards from hand, he draws five more and continues playing. When no more plays are available, the player discards one card to either an empty discard pile or on top of an existing one and play passes to the next player. When a build pile reaches 12, it is removed from the board and that space becomes empty for another pile to be started; play continues until one player has played his final start card.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NWNQ311J5JK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Fear for Sale: The Dusk Wanderer","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.58787.14446122521805266.3d4ae0f0-26cf-43d3-8e9c-ab9c7ab27c83.f0bd7c92-05e3-400f-a7d5-6eddbad101e2","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.40362.14446122521805266.3d4ae0f0-26cf-43d3-8e9c-ab9c7ab27c83.d49148a5-f525-468b-87f4-7b83122015b7","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62293.14446122521805266.445ee714-ee1e-432f-94e7-3948dd7dc759.d3b9f930-ccf4-49dd-ad07-be42caef836b","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25996.14446122521805266.445ee714-ee1e-432f-94e7-3948dd7dc759.aa937fad-69f3-4178-a1c9-c6fa766ad458","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"$9.99","Price":9.99,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["BigFishGames.FearforSaleTheDuskWanderer_bsrvrvej7yy2w"],"ContentIds":["a68f73f0-02fe-1374-7957-01318da2db34"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"EleFun Games proudly presents the newest addition to the Fear For Sale series!

The game faithfully matches the timeline of the comics, meaning Rick must first fight his way out of the Harrison Memorial Hospital, visit the Greene family farm before visiting destinations such as the Meirwether Correctional Facility and Woodbury.\r\n\r\nProtect the living and escape the dead as you play through the award-winning comic's epic story.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N86H60RLGFJ","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Onopoly: Business Board Game","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7490.14055276713084873.9b09f693-80e7-41e0-9924-e8e9e5710af3.6b50fe43-1e67-4808-aff2-7fc9b9305e22","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.14339.14055276713084873.9b09f693-80e7-41e0-9924-e8e9e5710af3.bc5c5288-cde6-4185-9762-b810330c0d92","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"11","PackageFamilyNames":["44206SilentMonkGames.OnopolyBusinessBoardGame_9nr9yt7wn1prj"],"ContentIds":["2b69c65a-0aea-d205-36a0-bb05a213ae4a","e51a809d-fbd8-410a-4cc2-f5ff45e64a20"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Wheel and deal your way to the fortune and play the classic game of Onopoly!
