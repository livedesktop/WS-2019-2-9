Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.\r\n\r\nPlay against the computer, against your friends in Local mode or with Thousands of Onopoly players around the world in Online Multiplayer Mode.\r\n\r\nYou can also create Private Rooms and invite your friends to play in Play with Friends Mode.\r\n\r\nOnopoly is a simple game: you start off with some money, and your goal is to be the last player standing with money.

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    - Money or Match play style\r\n    - Doubling cube\r\n    - Sound on/off\r\n    - Show possible moves\r\n    - Animation speed\r\n    - Auto-throw-dice\r\n    - Strict tournament rules\r\n    - Dice randomness \r\n    - Show PIP and point numbers\r\n    - Try different moves, then ‘accept’ or ‘undo’\r\n    - Beaver rule\r\n* Auto-save: don’t lose games in progress\r\n* Always fun: the phone plays differently every time\r\n\r\nAlso available on Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIn Windows Phone, 'Backgammon Pro+' paid version has no Ads\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n===============\r\nv1.99 - Ad option to remove ads for free, UI improvements, keyboard shortcuts (ESC=back, U=Undo), save to roaming storage to preserve all settings and statistics even when reinstalling\r\nv1.15 - optimized for WP8, fast app resume, larger screens, higher resolution icon\r\nv1.14- faster dice rotation when there is a cube\r\nv1.13- new Mercenne Twister random algorithm, faster dice rotation when possible, do not throw dice if bar is full\r\nv2.11-2.12 - bug fixes, UI fixes","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NKP7KQ9NN9K","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Golden Farm","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.54068.13652745263149880.670caff1-1950-4ce7-9768-383e6daac5ad.1e852d13-1405-448f-bd5c-dc6ed352baa9","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.22288.13652745263149880.10bad5af-34a1-4f73-981d-143f180d6020.ddfabbea-c2f0-49a6-8b93-bede0e2af211","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35831.13652745263149880.2b143116-5622-40cd-a957-81b831d4c197.889a750d-442a-452b-adcc-3b2da5c56256","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["4ACEF246.GoldenFarm_05g3z837ka020"],"ContentIds":["5b3b8172-dbf9-2939-a722-90dce7116f6c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"A new hit farm simulation!

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRFJ31P","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Logos Quiz+","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.36637.9007199266246024.f686e70b-d24c-4234-b42c-cd4d82e291d5.081c0862-17ba-4154-89ca-509494884995","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.63091.9007199266246024.3dbed398-f8ca-4e07-b5b9-a04f4ea80039.b875f4ef-7cc4-4586-a39d-33e43faa281c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["32988BernardoZamora.LogosQuiz_1fgex2kbsn6g8"],"ContentIds":["0efd6ef0-120e-8661-4b27-c58db06dd6c5","d0022555-6151-fb82-84cb-f497e59b5b3b","a76c2356-5235-e257-7960-3f78c7dd79b6"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"GUESS WHAT ARE 640 LOGOS OR IMAGES!\r\n\r\nWe see logos every day in TV, in the street and in the products we use, but don’t really notice them.\r\n\r\nCan you solve all the logos and become a *Logo Master*?\r\nLearn more about all the logos and what they represent!\r\nUse the hints to help you guess the names!\r\n\r\n640 LOGOS!\r\n\r\nHundreds of beautiful high resolution logos and images, partially obscured to make the game more challenging!\r\n\r\nHINTS and STARS\r\n\r\nThousands of hints available to help you guess the logos.

It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.\r\nDuring the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board. The player with white pieces always makes the first move. Because of this, White has a small advantage, and wins more often than Black in tournament games.\r\nDeveloping Chess strategy and improving your Chess skill!

A crime syndicate that operates in deep secrecy to steal the most valuable items around the world.\r\nAre you ready for a life of crime? Become our new recruit and download this action-packed stealth game now!\r\n\r\nJust some of the awesome features:\r\n⛬ Unique stealth play\r\nDynamics shadows and lights offering unique stealth experience\r\n⛬ Many cool gadgets to unlock\r\n ⚬ Night vision goggle\r\n ⚬ Thermal (heat) goggles\r\n ⚬ Stun gun\r\n ⚬ Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons\r\n ⚬ Digital map\r\n ⚬ so much more to come\r\n⛬ Take-downs\r\nNeutralize guards and drag them out of sight\r\n⛬ Multiple campaigns with many missions\r\nSteal priceless items around the world in a full career-mode\r\n⛬ Control the environment\r\nDestroy lights, eliminate security cams\r\n\r\nThe art of stealth\r\nYou will need to operate in complete silence and remain undetected as you steal objects from the most secure locations. Avoid or neutralize guards, sneak past security cameras, and maneuver past anti-theft security laser pointer systems. It's all part of your daily occupation as a notorious thief.\r\n\r\nThe key to completing successful missions in this stealth game is remaining undetected. Use the shadows and any tiny corner to your advantage. You often have multiple options to a situation, will you take-down a guards or will you simply sneak by. While missions can be completed whilst detected, the true art of stealth is to achieve 100% stealth scores for your missions.\r\n\r\nGame-play TIPS\r\n1. Use the dark shadows\r\nWatch your stealth visibility indicator at the bottom/right of the screen closely to see how visible you are. By staying in the dark shadows you will remain invisible to the guards and this allows you to sneak past them undetected.\r\n2. Use gadgets wisely\r\nAs you complete missions you're arsenal of gadgets and gear expands, but your resources remain limited. Use your ammunition wisely throughout the missions as you may come cross critical situations when you will desperately need your weapons.\r\n3. Drag guards into the shadow\r\nTo avoid any later detection of knocked out guards you need to be sure to drag them out of sight into a dark corner or behind cover. Detection of a guards leads to the alarm being raised and will negatively impact your stealth % score.\r\n4. Be patient\r\nThey key to any stealth game is to be patient and observe the situation and then take measured and planning action accordingly.\r\n\r\nYour gadgets\r\nComplete missions and you will be rewarded by the syndicate with new high-tech gadgets allowing you to complete the most challenging heists against all odds. Pay close attention to the gadget training missions.\r\n\r\nThe jobs\r\nThis stealth game presents a simulation of the life of a pro modern criminal.
