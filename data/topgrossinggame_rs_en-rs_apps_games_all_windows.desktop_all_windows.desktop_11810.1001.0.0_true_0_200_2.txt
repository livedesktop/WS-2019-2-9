The coins are also used to restore lives and buy rum for the sailors in order to open new episodes.\r\nCollect treasures, compete with your friends and become a real pirate!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZ60FK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Don't break the eggs!","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.39336.13510798884069776.7d0802b5-07a7-4902-bfec-a3a5b30e90c8.90499b70-78ff-4e1a-8d26-a2ece6dca2dd","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#B9804C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.18379.13510798884069776.95ab3366-bb98-48ae-8324-1139692fb239.3cd394c1-79e1-469e-ba71-f118962e4e6c","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#B9804C","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":5.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["53388MutantBearGames.Dontbreaktheeggs_5pfgqq4dahhzr"],"ContentIds":["e97183ef-bcfd-2350-e9b7-087af08d4a32","a3bb1906-aa65-a702-6436-44bab9a984e2"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Detonate the farm blocks in order to bring all the eggs to the nest in this classic physics game.\r\n\r\nThe little eggs were playing around and, nobody knows how, they managed to get to the most dangerous places of the farm!\r\n\r\nBring all the eggs back to the hen's nest and help them become chicks!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGGZ62XM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Temple of the Dead - 3D FPS","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2921.13510798884071588.877824cc-99ce-413f-8ad5-9da802d6ff6d.585acd53-84a7-4445-a54d-b2d760d0b409","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.16385.13510798884071588.55fa2949-4fae-47d9-b216-673af16e55f2.44cd71f5-e752-4ee8-a99d-59d7ba84bc00","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["AbsoLogixTechnologiesLimi.TempleoftheDead-3DFPS_bqy72ee6esnst"],"ContentIds":["39c631a9-78cd-5fe1-9037-00ae73121634"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Walk around a deadly temple and find your way to find the treasure room filled with gold and jewels.

His freedom will now be at risk, because a hunter has landed on the island to add this rare animal to his private zoo.\r\nThis tiny bird with the name fector will have to keep his eyes wide open in order to escape from his enemies hands.\r\n\r\nYour task will be to try and help our fluffy friend to keep his life as it is and rescue him, from what could become a real dungeon.\r\nAppeal to all your abilities to get him out of trouble, dodge big waterfalls, rocks and do not get cached from the hunter’s net. Land on the beach to kick the crabs back in the water and then take off quickly.  \r\nRemember to fly always within the confines of the island delimited by the beach, as the ocean is hiding a big danger.  In fact the island is permanently being controlled by a hungry shark that is always waiting for a new tasty pray.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures:\t\r\n\r\n- Easy touch and tilt control\r\n- Original 3D-run function combines jumping, turning and change of altitude (nosedive).\r\n- Colorful graphics and smooth animations\r\n- One of the coolest animal apps to play with!\r\n- The never-ending mega game\r\n- 3 different game modes: Run (normal), slow (easy), fast (hard)\r\n- Special abilities:\r\n- Lightning: Makes you fly much faster (at a nearly uncontrollable speed)\r\n- Snail: Resets your speed to normal (slows you down)\r\n- Green flare: Makes you invincible for 10 seconds (The only thing you have to remember is to turn at every corner)\r\n\r\nAdvise: Be a good vactor and catch the Snails on the ground during your rush to slow down the speed and increase the possibility of getting farther.\r\n\r\nWarning: Avoid the lightning power up that are suspended in the air, as it will give you a super turbo boost that makes you incredibly fast, but you will probably quickly lose control of the flappy bird. The only way to stop the high speed is to take a snail.\r\n\r\n3, 2, 1 go! Start your cartoon running adventure!\r\n\r\nThis is a fun and free application.

And best of all, grab a snowmobile and pull off epic jumps once more!\r\n\r\nJURASSIC LARK\r\n\r\nIt's about time. A jurassic jungle full of prehistoric pals like the Pterodactyl, the Woolly Mammoth and a baby Ankylosaurus. These ancient animals have a dino-mite plan for our intrepid stars! Race against the \"Lavalanche\", slide along vines, or just go crazy performing tricks as you try to avoid rocks, stalactites and pools of molten lava!\r\n\r\nTWISTER CANYON\r\n\r\nPerhaps the gentle rolling of the tumbleweeds is more your pace. Unfortunately, they didn't call it Twister Canyon for nothing. A fierce twister is headed straight for Sven and Evana! They just can't catch a break, can they?\r\n\r\nHere you'll find an assortment of ragtag rapscallions including Sheriff Yeti, Chief Penguin, and even an Armadillo! Ride in a mine cart, hop on a rickety railway, grind along a telegraph wire or watch the Yeti play the piano! It's how the wild, wild west was meant to be.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1JXSH","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dress Up: Hime","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.26522.13510798885992984.2e42bbe0-a960-4e1c-8b8c-65eebce79f7b.418eeb4f-1f1f-4919-8e67-6c7d1602a9fd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["29654uslight.DressUpHime_j11n5d0xh9kme"],"ContentIds":["5cb39f2a-70fd-0387-a615-b3a143e46b36","c7e9046b-f8fc-475d-8d86-ed110e3ce0e4","39b6e5c4-30ce-414c-2179-b51f4ae63f07"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a free game for girls.

It is fundamentally different from most solitaire games in that very few hands are unsolvable. Although software implementations vary, most versions label the hands with a number (derived from the random number seed used to generate the hand).\r\n\r\nA version of FreeCell was created by Microsoft for release with the Windows operating system.\r\n\r\nFreeCell solitaire is one kinds of funny solitaire card game, but it's not like other solitaires. You need no luck to win, only skill is required. All cards are opened from the start and the deal has the solution, you can win, think and move wisely. \r\n\r\nKey Features: \r\n- deals with different difficulty \r\n- every completed deal has score \r\n- customizable background and card \r\n- magnetic card movement \r\n- supermove: multiple card dragging \r\n- drag or tap to move \r\n- undo option \r\n- optimized battery usage for very long gameplay \r\n\r\nRules\r\nConstruction and layout\r\nOne standard 52-card deck is used.\r\nThere are four open cells and four open foundations. Some alternate rules use between one to ten cells.\r\nCards are dealt into eight cascades, four of which comprise seven cards and four of which comprise six. Some alternate rules will use between four to ten cascades.\r\n\r\nBuilding during play\r\nThe top card of each cascade begins a tableau.\r\nTableaux must be built down by alternating colors.\r\nFoundations are built up by suit.\r\n\r\nMoves\r\nAny cell card or top card of any cascade may be moved to build on a tableau, or moved to an empty cell, an empty cascade, or its foundation.\r\nComplete or partial tableaus may be moved to build on existing tableaus, or moved to empty cascades, by recursively placing and removing cards through intermediate locations. Computer implementations often show this motion, but players using physical decks typically move the tableau at once.\r\n\r\nVictory\r\nThe game is won after all cards are moved to their foundation piles.\r\nVarious computer versions of Freecell occasionally deal unsolvable games.\r\n\r\n\r\nHistory\r\nOne of the oldest ancestors of FreeCell is Eight Off. In the June 1968 edition of Scientific American, Martin Gardner described in his \"Mathematical Games\" column a game by C. L. Baker that is similar to FreeCell, except that cards on the tableau are built by suit rather than by alternate colors. Gardner wrote, \"The game was taught to Baker by his father, who in turn learned it from an Englishman during the 1920s.\" This variant is now called Baker's Game. FreeCell's origins may date back even further to 1945 and a Scandinavian game called Napoleon in St. Helena (not the game Napoleon at St. Helena, also known as Forty Thieves).\r\n\r\nPaul Alfille changed Baker's Game by making cards build according to alternate colors, thus creating FreeCell. He implemented the first computerised version of it in the TUTOR programming language for the PLATO educational computer system in 1978. Alfille was able to display easily recognizable graphical images of playing cards on the 512 * 512 monochrome display on the PLATO systems.\r\n\r\nThis original FreeCell environment allowed games with 4–10 columns and 1–10 cells in addition to the standard 8 * 4 game. For each variant, the program stored a ranked list of the players with the longest winning streaks. There was also a tournament system that allowed people to compete to win difficult hand-picked deals. Paul Alfille describes this early FreeCell environment in more detail in an interview from 2000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSolver complexity\r\nThe FreeCell game has a constant number of cards. This implies that in constant time, a person or computer could list all of the possible moves from a given start configuration and discover a winning set of moves or, assuming the game cannot be solved, the lack thereof. To perform an interesting complexity analysis one must construct a generalized version of the FreeCell game with 4 * n cards. This generalized version of the game is NP-complete; it is unlikely that any algorithm more efficient than a brute-force search exists that can find solutions for arbitrary generalized FreeCell configurations.\r\n\r\nThere are 52! (i.e., 52 factorial), or approximately 8*1067, distinct deals. However, some games are effectively identical to others because suits assigned to cards are arbitrary or columns can be swapped. After taking these factors into account, there are approximately 1.75*1064 distinct games.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1NTVK","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Play Football kicks","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59551.13510798885969526.51e4bebb-30ee-4ce9-81c8-8a9f10990672.ae99d5d1-0d8d-45c7-bf5d-1f7c567eb440","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.2103.13510798885969526.078f8451-9362-4c11-9f54-7591a6e86702.48188406-a542-4aa5-8c46-b6eb83fee3f2","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50154AVLogix.PlayFootballkicks_q7ke2emr2nmbw"],"ContentIds":["387f2144-2bfd-7800-9b66-848bbf35a751","4ad21b1b-3ac2-f886-29f6-0d585ca54efc"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Soccer is an ancient game which were started over hundred years ago.

For those that want a puzzle that lasts more than a few minutes. And now an unlimited supply of automatically generated 9 x 9 Sudokus for when you want a quick puzzle.\r\n\r\nThe Samurai and Super Sudokus come in three levels of difficulty, none of them are trivial or easy.  These are Sudoku that will take a bit of time to solve.  And if you complete one you will have solved it.  There are no cheats or hints to allow you to carry on if you get stuck. The 9x9 Sudoku come in four levels of difficulty with the most difficult requiring slightly harder solving techniques than the larger puzzles.\r\n\r\nThere are aids to help with some of the legwork though, the Sudoku will auto fill and update pencil marks showing all of the possible numbers available in each square and you can highlight all squares that can hold a possible number allowing patterns to be seen.  But, there is nothing in the Sudoku to shortcut the mental process required to complete it.\r\n\r\nThe list of Sudoku now shows whether automatic pencil marks or number highlighting have been used and the best time for each Sudoku will reflect this, if you complete a Sudoku without using assistance this will be recorded as your best even if it was slower than a previous attempt where assistance was used.\r\n\r\nThe Sudoku auto save so you can have several on the go at any time.\r\n\r\nAlso for traditionalists or the masochistic you can email a Sudoku to your computer to be printed out and solved the hard way with no highlighting assistance using a pen and paper.\r\n\r\nBecause of the size of the Sudoku this app will work best on a PC, tablet  or large screen phone.  However, the grid can be zoomed so play on almost any device should be possible with a pit of patience.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1R48S","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Dress Up: Royal Wedding","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.35989.13510798886153975.b7e33b4b-0909-46e8-9fe7-66e72468b4f8.f357466e-78ba-4311-a97a-f872d0cbb709","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.38310.13510798886153975.5da7025d-6a17-48fa-a31f-0f5affcdf61f.4f0405f4-3e4c-4777-98eb-224776d3d45d","Height":310,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25518.13510798886153975.6f06aeed-07e8-4f97-a9ed-56e433b450b1.6fe0b81a-0043-46d0-9806-f2a50f0e17fc","Height":620,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.24596.13510798886153975.e33d89b1-aeea-4bfb-af17-422ae04826bf.35046096-542b-4f93-84c6-cd185e7798d3","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37096.13510798886153975.1d5c96b7-d535-4dca-9603-534cc6d8ae50.1a05df8e-cdb4-42f6-8b31-6d9f72b69464","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FF0000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["29654uslight.DressUpRoyalWedding_j11n5d0xh9kme"],"ContentIds":["f1c396ae-1e7f-1d8b-e226-6189f0e17b08","9f03adcf-4612-3cde-61e0-da14e1afce6c","542c235e-be0f-8e17-5396-7021b2042341"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"This is a free game for girls.

He tried to make plans to go out as soon as the weather gets better and regroup with his men and find his way out in this unknown valley.\r\n\r\nThe morning light brought with it calmness to the weather. It was still raining but it was possible to go out and look for his men and hunt for some food.\r\n\r\nIt is time to load up your sniper rifle and jump into the wilds. Play the role of Captain Foster and help him feed himself. You have one Elite Sniper Rifle which can be used for hunting but if you use your Elite shooting skills and successfully hunt some deer, you can buy high range sniper guns.\r\n\r\nTo kill a deer, simply find it with help of long range gun scope and follow deer’s tracks to take a clear headshot. Keep in mind though that you are among the wilds and trying to eat what would have ended up as the lion’s food. You have to hunt the deer before getting to the loins or you will lose the hunt and the lions can you.\r\n\r\nYou will see beautiful sceneries like wildlife, forest and mountains in the game and enjoy the sounds of weapons, lions, birds and family of Red & Mole dear's.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH3TN71","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"9 Clues 2: The Ward","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.28718.13510798884694988.3a3681b9-c06f-49e0-a106-9314cffdb1b5.bf016bec-51f3-44ef-9fd4-c5fa7cce802c","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["ArtifexMundi.9Clues2TheWard_xmkq9zz36w32m"],"ContentIds":["47d795ce-c090-cfa2-4ca6-ea4455a906e0"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"FANTASTIC HIDDEN OBJECT PUZZLE ADVENTURE GAME FROM THE CREATORS OF ENIGMATIS AND GRIM LEGENDS!\r\nTwo detectives respond to a distressing call from a rainy island housing an insane asylum.
