Backgammon is a board game in which you move the pieces around the board according to dice rolls. Once you get all the pieces in the house you take them out according to your dice. The first player to get all the pieces out wins the game.\r\nDownload and play now!\r\n\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ FEATURES ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ challenging AI\r\n\r\n✓ auto bear off\r\n\r\n✓ easy to select and move pieces\r\n\r\n✓ fluid animations \r\n\r\n✓ HD graphics\r\n\r\n✓ detailed statistics\r\n\r\n✓ nice music and sound effects\r\n\r\n★ ★ ★ TIPS ★ ★ ★ \r\n\r\n✓ Your pieces are white and your opponent's pieces are black. There are 24 places on the board and two places to deposit the pieces. The 24 places are represented as triangles and called points. So the 1-point is the first place where pieces can stay. \r\n\r\n✓ The points from 1 to 6 are called the opponents’ home and the points from 19 to 24 are your home on the board. The opponent needs to bring all his pieces in the home region in order to take them out and so do you.\r\n\r\n✓ You can move around the board in one direction. You move from the bottom-right corner to the bottom-left corner then to the top-left corner and finally to the top-right corner on a path that resembles a horseshoe. The points from 1 to 24 follow this path in the same direction. Your opponent moves in the opposite direction following this path. \r\n\r\n✓ The game starts with a couple of dice rolls that decide which player should begin first. The opponent rolls first, then you. The one with the biggest pips’ count on the dice starts first. A pip is a dot on the face of a dice which counts as a point of movement or placement.\r\n\r\n✓ When your turn comes you start by rolling the dice and continue by making the moves.\r\n\r\n✓ If you roll a double your pips count will be twice the pips�� sum of the dice.\r\n\r\n✓ After you roll the dice some top pieces on your triangles, will be highlighted. You can start your move with any of those highlighted pieces. To move the pieces, you select the piece by tapping on the triangle on which it lies. Then, at that point the triangle turns blue and the places to which you can move next turn green. Tap on any of those green triangles to initiate the move. When the move ends and if there are moves left on the dice new pieces will be highlighted.\r\n\r\n✓ If one of your dice is one you can move one of your pieces only one position. If the piece lies on 2-point you can move it on 3-point for example.

We specialize in educational games with the fun built right into them.\r\n\r\nLet's do the rest of the description in a question-and-answer form.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ How is the game played? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nIn the first lesson, children listen to the names of colors while a fun brush puts a big splash of the color on an easel, accompanied by an entertaining sound effect that makes the splash against the easel sound real.\r\n\r\nThen children learn how to recognize colors with a series of colorful jellyfish that float down with likable expressions on their faces. The pleasant lady announcer asks kids to choose the blue, yellow, purple, or black jellyfish. Each time children choose the correct one, she congratulates them with encouraging words like \"Perfect!\" and \"You're Good!\"\r\n\r\nNext, children discover how to build their color memories. An identical, pretty design shows up on the screen in rows. When kids tap on one of the designs, a color is revealed. Then the color disappears behind the design. Kids keep tapping until they remember where some of the colors are. Then when they tap on a design that matches one of the colors they remember the location of, they go back and tap it.\r\n\r\n★★★★★ What will my children learn? ★★★★★\r\n\r\nLike all Intellijoy games, the game focuses on a specific educational lesson, so children and their parents find the game really inviting and distraction-free.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, your child will learn:\r\n\r\n✔ The names of colors by splashing colors onto an easel.\r\n\r\n✔ How to recognize colors by being asked to do things like \"Choose the purple jellyfish.\"\r\n\r\n✔ Build memory skills by matching a color they've just seen.\r\n\r\nWe love to hear from parents – and from children, too. To tell us how we made a difference in your child's education or your sanity level, please rate our app and post a comment.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDG126","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Special Enquiry Detail: The Hand that Feeds HD","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.10009.9007199266305937.a09eaf92-d005-467f-a158-d01a082e5795.cf30e7f3-0f67-4e67-9cc5-fcadfe5c0d81","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.62445.9007199266305937.da762b7a-c3e7-453e-858c-dd65a7e988a2.ad2520a5-6263-4a33-b367-ab2dcb8ef050","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.49518.9007199266305937.0554e406-7677-42fe-8079-199ab572725a.d419b74b-5540-476f-8c51-6d9c55bd9877","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.64154.9007199266305937.5fcaff3b-0eee-4e35-baf8-604fbfe25b0e.0a1b31a6-536e-4d44-ad2f-d2b057adad13","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.6557.9007199266305937.0225cd92-214e-412d-89b3-bded058523aa.4ce442cc-1b60-4074-bbaf-380e448923cd","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.microsoft.com/image/apps.13776.9007199266305937.13380a24-57bb-40c6-8b1a-0d7d57e4e531.200863e4-a738-4dec-8026-9a3c152793f4","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#034ca2","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":1.5,"RatingsCount":"2","PackageFamilyNames":["828B5831.SpecialEnquiryDetailTheHandthatFeeds_ytsefhwckbdv6"],"ContentIds":["bf840ade-be64-b75f-879c-49f8e0a0b157"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Try your hand at investigating a crime, crack the case and catch the criminal in this perplexing hidden-object game!

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDK4KM","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"MineSweeper (Free)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5306.9007199266520798.aa665d60-ac13-4776-aeea-4e5a712805f1.7938e915-f290-4999-a352-83ccad202ec3","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61468.9007199266520798.a8271344-a175-4f03-8fc0-f4975c4d1c86.3ae80966-3934-48da-9718-6f7a58340e69","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"transparent","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["50834ZAppsStudio.MineSweeperFree_fr8j70y4p4pst"],"ContentIds":["3ed47e06-197d-bd64-bb65-07d9aa44a61d","37af19aa-79db-a4b4-8996-0f9169231a98","1d6251cf-030f-7ceb-89ab-8d975d91b721"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"MineSweeper is classic windows game.\r\n\r\nMinesweeper is a logic game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares.

An early variant of Tic-tac-toe was played in Roman Empire, around the first century BC. It was called Terni Lapilli and instead of having any number of pieces, each player only had three, thus they had to move them around to empty spaces to keep playing. The game's grid markings have been found chalked all over Rome. However, there is some evidence to suggest that Tic-Tac-Toe could originate back to ancient Egypt. \r\nThe different names of the game are more recent. The first print reference to \"noughts and crosses\", the British name, appeared in 1864. The first print reference to a game called \"tick-tack-toe\" occurred in 1884, but referred to \"a children's game played on a slate, consisting in trying with the eyes shut to bring the pencil down on one of the numbers of a set, the number hit being scored\". \"Tic-tac-toe\" may also derive from \"tick-tack\", the name of an old version of backgammon first described in 1558. The U.S. renaming of noughts and crosses as tic-tac-toe occurred in the 20th century. \r\nWhen playing against a phone, human player is always 'O'. The player who succeeds in placing three respective marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game. Using menu button, game can be configured to play on the larger boards to connect 4 pieces, or between 2 people.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMLVN","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Bad Nerd - School RPG","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.42124.9007199266448791.fa0f079b-e09a-4f6f-b62c-750d93c49e04.c67d47ed-c550-4153-b2ca-abd4c540ad7f","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37851.9007199266448791.38f4e3d1-2a40-46ed-8922-da8f66fc0a8f.b25a6a7b-fec8-494f-97ad-6d2dd7054196","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["VNLEntertainmentLtd.BadNerd-SchoolRPG_xaadq54jk5f4e"],"ContentIds":["9c1b78c6-a5f1-37dc-2e3a-5e8b7dfc5188","1bc338f0-29e1-673b-8b47-bd665e2370be"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"NOTE: This game requires touch input and does not support mouse and keyboard.\r\n\r\nSee a nerd unleash the nerd rage like never before!\r\n\r\nIf you are a fan of modern action RPGs with lots of fighting then you will love Bad Nerd!\r\nJoin Bad Nerd in his quest to rid the school of bullies!

In fact, at first glance you might think of it as a bit of a joke. I mean seriously, no graphics or sound at all? What kind of game is that? Long before quality graphics and sound was available on game systems, there were playable stories. Some have called them ‘Interactive Fiction’, others ‘Text Adventure Games’. Instead of using the machine’s graphic and sound capabilities, they used the player’s imagination. This game has been specifically designed to reignite that lost game genre while implementing a modern interface that makes for a surprisingly refreshing gaming experience.\r\n\r\nThis Christian themed story begins with an accident. An accident that leaves you, as the player, unable to recall not only where you are, but who you are as well. Awakening in an overturned van, being suspended by your seatbelt, you must first figure a way of escape. Once free to explore the area, you find yourself in a world that not only seems strangely empty, but openly hostile as well. As the story unfolds and your memory begins to return, you begin to question whether these strange happenings are limited to the immediate area. If your experience of this small town is reflective of the state of the world, then things are certainly not as they used to be!\r\n\r\nA word of warning! This seemingly dark tale is refreshed by a large number of humorous responses that if caught unaware, may have you bursting out in spontaneous laughter. This may cause embarrassment if played in a public place. In fact, no matter how many hours are spent playing this game, it would be nearly impossible to discover every comical response.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDQSL1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tic-tac-toe Universe 4D","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.59613.9007199266542602.8c067ac2-9e7a-460a-bfe9-ce44856ecd69.63c7f998-bfcc-4079-b15d-09ce9403023b","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#002C5B","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53430TrumpSoftware.Tic-tac-toeUniverse_xqb6kmrnnyfrr"],"ContentIds":["c7bcedff-748d-c54e-33f1-2ab14ed945f1"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"We all familiar with the \"Tic-Tac-Toe\" game since childhood.

We thought they were dim-witted, clumsy, unworthy adversaries. We thought they would soon be on our Thanksgiving dinner table again. We thought wrong.\r\n\r\nThey had outside help. Intergalactic turkeys flocked to the aid of their earthly brethren. They were intelligent, organized, technologically advanced. And they were merciless.\r\n\r\nIt's now time for you to fight for our ancestral right to turkey roast. Will you triumph over the foul fowls? Will mankind ever have Thanksgiving dinner again? Or will you end up as part of the menu in a galactic turkey restaurant?","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDRJN0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Tic Tac Toe(Xs and Os)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23781.9007199266560615.aa3802e2-0eca-42d6-b85d-1025ab017083.e63a74af-aead-42d1-a920-eed91444194d","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#00A57E","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["2165Gazar.BoterKaasenEierenGame_fqcsazvr4n6ky"],"ContentIds":["137ae656-1f51-0052-a03a-a37f33b2986b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Tic Tac Toe is a very simple but addictive puzzle game.

Carrom is a similar to Billiards or Table Shuffleboard game however instead of pool cues you use your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe object of the game is to flick a striker to hit and pocket a playing coin. The coins can be pocketed into any pocket.\r\n\r\nAs there are a huge number of variations in the rules exists so this App 'tries' to support 2 types of popular Carrom game play i.e. 'Family-Point' and 'Professional' and implements only those Carrom rules which I found practical to implement.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n1. App does not allowed to strike backward from carrom-stricker baseline.\r\n2. Due to scoring rules in 'Professional' game play mode, scoring can only be possible after current round is over.\r\n3. Player sides does not change during the game rather first player breaks first for odd (e.g. 1, 3 ...) number rounds and second player breaks first in even (e.g. 2, 4 ...) number rounds.\r\n4. Max number of rounds for 'Family-Point' game is 5 while 'Professional' mode game is 8. Player can always 'Give up' game during rounds play then game will declares game winner!\r\n5. App provides user to save up to maximum of 9 game plays. \r\n\r\nNote: I have recently released online version of this game app name 'Carrom online', if you are interested to play online please do try that app.\r\n\r\nKindly rate this app that would encourage me to come with new updates and improvements in future.
