So, yep we mastered AI along time ago!\r\n\r\nRegardless of your playing level, ZingMagic's multi award winning Chess is a fun, stimulating and challenging game for beginners and champions alike.\r\n\r\nChess is a two player game with a colourful history which can be traced back to its Indian ancestor, Chaturanga. In 1291 the Archbishop of Canterbury in England threatened clergy who continued playing Chess with a diet of bread and water.  \r\nThe game has flourished over the years and is now one of the most popular board games in the world, requiring thought, skill and strategy to become successful.\r\n\r\nThe object of Chess is to capture the opponent's King.  To capture the King you must place it in check.  If the King cannot escape by itself, or with the help of its army, it is in checkmate and the King is captured.\r\n \r\nZingMagic’s multi award winning Chess application supports over 20 levels of play allowing you to play moves or games against the clock or relax and play at your own pace. Whatever level of Chess you choose, you can be sure that ZingMagic’s Chess will give you a fun, stimulating and challenging game.\r\n\r\nThis game is ad-funded.

Play #1 hit Bridge Construction !\r\nPut your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor. For all lovers constructing games and building games like megapolis or sim city builder game.\r\n\r\nYou will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!\r\n\r\nIn addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.\r\n\r\nThe game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.\r\n\r\nRealistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NHP2RNRS2DC","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Unknown City (Horror Begins Now.....Episode 1) Demo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30957.13622086984955660.dfa407ed-f182-4685-8b81-52d250834947.3fe9ee7d-273b-4639-8883-73638ce112de","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33716.13622086984955660.dfa407ed-f182-4685-8b81-52d250834947.8d00d1aa-e7e6-4861-8145-4d82a2fd15de","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19892.13622086984955660.dfa407ed-f182-4685-8b81-52d250834947.9a4be1a1-52e1-46b9-9722-b46943b420bc","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52336.13622086984955660.dfa407ed-f182-4685-8b81-52d250834947.84e04272-d4df-4257-be8c-8c7ee218ea98","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["YASHFUTURETECHSOLUTIONSPV.1243464FD7AF0_rs8r5b65h5hnj"],"ContentIds":["38f1ee92-e293-a914-77cc-c93a74ec0e7b","d8dab7f7-7d9d-f0ca-2fb5-80351091241b"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"he Unknown City is a First Person Shooter game series based on a Horror Theme wrapped inside a gripping story along with amazing effects with a climax that will leave the players wanting to play next episodes of this series.
