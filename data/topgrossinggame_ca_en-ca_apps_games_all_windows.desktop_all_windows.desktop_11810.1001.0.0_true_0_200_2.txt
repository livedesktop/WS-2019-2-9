One such system is the ability to choose between “Power” and “Speed” styles when selecting a character. The “Power” system focuses on high damage while the “Speed” system focuses more on intricate combos and speed. The game also features a unique “Hajiki” ability that allows players to deflect or repel attacks. The game also allows the player to cancel super attacks into Desperation Moves adding another strategic element to the game. Finally, the game features a wealth of flashy attacks thanks to the inclusion of Super Secret Skills and Super Desperation Moves.\r\n\r\nThe \"ACA NEOGEO\" series has faithfully reproduced many classic NEOGEO masterpieces.\r\nPlayers can change various game settings such as game difficulty, and also reproduce the atmosphere of arcade display settings at that time.

Is the horrifying, undead pirate really as evil as he seems? \r\n\r\nYou will find answers to these questions during your trip through the ghost ship haunting the seas of the Caribbean, the grim Skull Island where pirates’ bones cover the ground, a ruined fortress ridden by cannonballs and catacombs stretching below the island’s surface.

Plan is a puzzle adventure game that takes place entirely inside an elevator. Go floor to floor, find items, and meet a bizarre cast of characters. Discover relationships between different things in the building and unlock its secrets. \r\n\r\nIt's the most fun you can have while stuck in an elevator.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\nElevator-Scale VR\r\nFloor Plan: Hands-On Edition adds full support for motion controllers to the original game. Walk around the elevator, grab things, and press buttons! Or if you'd rather enjoy your buttons from a distance, you can play seated or standing with a variety of control options. \r\n\r\nClassic Genre, New Paint\r\nFloor Plan takes mechanics from your favorite classic point-and-click adventure games and reimagines them for first person VR. Whether you dream of inventory puzzles or you're a newcomer to the genre, you'll see it like you've never seen it before.\r\n\r\nPlay Your Way\r\nFigure out alternate solutions to puzzles, solve them in different orders, or call the operator if you need a nudge in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT\r\nFloor Plan generally takes players about an hour to complete. We've priced it accordingly, and think it has enough special moments to be memorable and something you'll want to share with friends. Thanks for checking it out!\r\n\r\nYou can reach the developers on Twitter at

Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\r\n\r\nSTEALTH\r\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\r\n\r\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\r\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone.

Dogs are the most devoted friends. You can teach your cute puppy different commands. You can play ball, travel, and just take care of it. Dogs also have a great nose and are the best detectives! In exchange for their service, each dog dreams about a tasty bone! In this coloring book, you will find exciting scenes from the life of dogs of various breeds.\n\nPaint by numbers - an interactive coloring book for children. This mathematical game teaches children to recognize numbers and solve simple mathematical examples. In addition, this program develops memory, attention, imagination, and logical abilities.\nBoys and girls of all ages love to color. The simple coloring mode is suitable for the smallest of children, including those of kindergarten and preschool age. These include simple and recognizable images that are easy to color. If the child selects the wrong shape, then they will be prompted with the correct number. Therefore, the picture will always be colored correctly, and the child will quickly memorize the numbers. Children can choose to color by geometrical figures and pictograms in addition to numbers. A child can easily distinguish a square from a circle, diamond, and triangle.\nSchool-age children will enjoy the complex coloring mode. Here the picture is divided into a large number of elements, thus making it difficult at first to determine what it depicts. Older children can complicate the task by adding addition and subtraction tasks. Now children will need to solve the examples and choose the correct answers in order to color the picture. This will teach the child how to quickly do arithmetic in their mind.\nThose who are learning the alphabet can choose to color by letter. Coloring by letters will be useful for children preparing to enter primary school.\nTo make the coloring process more interesting and fun, you can change any of the preset colors. To do this, press and hold the jar of paint and a palette will open. Then you can choose your favorite color. Thus, all the shaded areas of the image can be changed in the coloring by number mode. You can have fun by changing the color scheme to suit your taste.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

Simulator is the latest in goat simulation technology, bringing next-gen goat simulation to YOU. You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\r\n\r\nKey Features\r\n• You can be a goat \r\n• Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \r\n• MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it \r\n• In-game physics that bug out all the time \r\n• Seriously look at that goat's neck \r\n• You can be a goat","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH1JK45","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Par 72 Golf IV","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.47138.13510798885982998.534ebe02-ccfa-4253-b15a-6482c033a786.7302865e-c8ce-49dd-bbb7-ad803edc11fd","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#0985d5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.46176.13510798885982998.cf4280a7-49bb-4d95-b235-bcf480339a0a.a830def8-4156-4550-9063-36f677b1a7d4","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#0985d5","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["28861RESETgame.Par72GolfIV_35b8x47qztent"],"ContentIds":["c57a5ecf-4863-4709-6d45-9c0648543e7f"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Par 72 Golf is a realistic 3D golf game featuring three 18 hole courses set in mountain, desert, and seaside environments.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5WMB8","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Omar Sharif Bridge","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5950.13510798886376447.fca5509d-5dce-4bc5-b764-1bb212020f93.f638f726-597b-4775-a312-cec8f072af03","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#222A7A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41424.13510798886376447.49fdf6bd-40a8-4ad6-9a8e-e55ad2b490d7.622430e2-d604-4b86-90b1-394aff6c81b8","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#222A7A","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.5161.13510798886376447.b3f3358c-8071-4d62-993b-bda99da844fd.0293f285-b2fb-4c2e-a5dc-6d2b5532a90c","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.9643.13510798886376447.911f6546-dcd9-41e2-9f31-06067de01866.edce6ab8-9ca6-497f-9b2f-2b18df6eb6d7","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $6.49","Price":6.49,"AverageRating":3.2,"RatingsCount":"4","PackageFamilyNames":["ZingMagicLimited.OmarSharifBridge_ekfg0vgp37mkp"],"ContentIds":["9384f022-1379-4fc0-3a30-fcf87659afa2","19afc404-c25e-e05f-8da2-3baa9debe1ef"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Welcome to the 2019 edition of Omar Sharif Bridge.

A game is won by the first partnership to score 100 or more points in successful contracts.\r\n\r\nIn Chicago Bridge you play four hands of Bridge.

Board pieces move based on dice throws.\r\n\r\nThis is a game of skill. A single game can be decided by luck, but the more one plays, the more the skill is important. After ~30 games the true skill emerges. Even a beginner can beat an expert through luck of draw in a single game, but after several games the skill prevails.\r\n\r\nThis version of Backgammon uses an advanced neural network in the highest levels, and will challenge advanced players. It also offers a fun experience for beginners, with lower difficulty levels and showing possible moves.\r\n\r\nThe scoring is based on the official Backgammon ELO system, with each game increasing or reducing rating points every game or match.\r\n\r\nFEATURES:\r\n=========\r\n* Worldwide online high scores\r\n* Play a Trial Game, or a Scored Game that counts towards your score\r\n* High res graphic board\r\n* Dice statistics history\r\n* Real time probability calculation\r\n* Achievements\r\n* Tutorials\r\n* 4 difficulty levels: easy to hard\r\n* 1 or 2 player mode\r\n* Many options:\r\n    - Money or Match play style\r\n    - Doubling cube\r\n    - Sound on/off\r\n    - Show possible moves\r\n    - Animation speed\r\n    - Auto-throw-dice\r\n    - Strict tournament rules\r\n    - Dice randomness \r\n    - Show PIP and point numbers\r\n    - Try different moves, then ‘accept’ or ‘undo’\r\n    - Beaver rule\r\n* Auto-save: don’t lose games in progress\r\n* Always fun: the phone plays differently every time\r\n\r\nAlso available on Windows Phone, Windows 8 and Windows 10.\r\n\r\nIn Windows Phone, 'Backgammon Pro+' paid version has no Ads\r\n\r\nVERSION HISTORY\r\n===============\r\nv1.99 - Ad option to remove ads for free, UI improvements, keyboard shortcuts (ESC=back, U=Undo), save to roaming storage to preserve all settings and statistics even when reinstalling\r\nv1.15 - optimized for WP8, fast app resume, larger screens, higher resolution icon\r\nv1.14- faster dice rotation when there is a cube\r\nv1.13- new Mercenne Twister random algorithm, faster dice rotation when possible, do not throw dice if bar is full\r\nv2.11-2.12 - bug fixes, UI fixes","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDMHT1","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Jane's Zoo","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27496.9007199266452308.06e9dae3-6857-408f-ad3e-597423f8bb50.d59a6565-6c8e-4adb-8ada-b675c493d955","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65484.9007199266452308.0d401cee-68ec-46b6-9396-78ef9d3831a1.71560c7d-9744-40e3-8d51-ffd5f8309eb7","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#92de36","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $4.49","Price":4.49,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["780F5C7B.JanesZoo_0gmyx1dmsk3dw"],"ContentIds":["2180952f-8e65-9c2a-26e6-d483646f8cf4"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Feel the spirit of freedom and plunge yourself into the world of wild nature!

First we get acquainted with domestic animals, like for example, fluffy kittens and playful dogs. On the street, we come across small insects and chirping, spotted birds. In the zoo we can view wild animals, such as rabbits, a fox, and a bear. Every time we learn more and more about these co-habitants of our Earth! Some of them creep along, while others run on their paws; still others soar through the air! Some prefer to live in burrows, some in nests, while others just live in the trees or sleep in meadows. You'll see huge elephants and hippopotamuses, small chameleons and frogs, fast lions and slow turtles - herbivores and predators alike. We invite you to get acquainted with these marvelous representatives of the animal kingdom on the pages of our game!  \r\n\r\nConnect points is a learning puzzle for small children. It helps develop thinking, improve memory and attention. The application has three game modes: by numbers, letters and coloring. Game modes with letters and numbers will be useful for kindergarten and pre-K kids. \r\nConnecting by numbers will help to easily memorize the order of numbers and learn to count. To do this, you need to consecutively connect circles with numbers starting from 1. As you connect circles in the right order, the silhouette of a hidden picture will become more and more visible. If three points are chosen incorrectly, a tip will pop up. Once all the points are fully connected, the picture will become fully visible and you’ll be able to color it.\r\nThose studying the alphabet can choose to connect points by letters. It is important that children know letters as early as possible, since it is essential for learning to read and write. But knowing the order of letters in the alphabet is also very important! This can be achieved by connecting circles with letters in the right sequence.\r\nThe coloring mode will be especially appreciated by young artists. In this mode, you can proceed to coloring pictures without connecting points. To make the process even more exciting, you can change any predefined color. To do this, press and hold the paint bucket and choose the necessary color from the palette.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9WZDNCRDLLBV","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Toca Train","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.51077.9007199266427129.945e330a-375f-4ba9-899f-6e3194b3f40a.89d3c1d4-8989-491c-8791-5f9fc0f5c034","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.61658.9007199266427129.6f2572e9-0eee-4426-bc33-5c97881aaffb.bc350494-0dfd-406e-97cf-d3722d18705d","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19427.9007199266427129.5608d8cd-5547-4fed-be83-8e44d6b27bc4.0f6a9755-59c8-4c1d-8e6b-3b5df4524b99","Height":210,"Width":210,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.41023.9007199266427129.abee3ea6-5272-4b37-86d9-b8710aaba9d5.ba37f262-7b86-4582-8758-b79bb6f3c4eb","Height":210,"Width":434,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.48107.9007199266427129.14b230fa-5c02-43cc-b107-e9fa0938c0af.b89b60ed-fa05-4318-be14-9865be906bb1","Height":270,"Width":270,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.8427.9007199266427129.4c537501-2175-4791-bb39-fd989e8a7961.5418ff01-9631-44bf-aa4e-9b0ccc87bd13","Height":270,"Width":558,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":4.3,"RatingsCount":"16","PackageFamilyNames":["TocaBocaAB.TocaTrain_e8swm3qhs311t"],"ContentIds":["fbaad582-e9c8-b737-f88f-65696697aa6c","c3b991f6-3d2f-8c04-a624-929b1a70c701"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"All aboard?

This isn't a shoot-em-up, just a laid-back, enjoyable way to learn how to play poker. Relax and have fun!\r\n\r\nAnnie, Cowboy, Gambler, and The Kid are four wisecracking card sharks who will try to take your money!\r\n\r\nEach player has his own unique style of play - and playing against those styles, combined with the Hints and context-based Strategy, should help you learn how to play poker. \r\n\r\nPlayers:\r\nAnnie: Annie is no stranger to these tables and she is much tougher than she looks. To her, poker is much more than a game, its how she makes her living. If you're not careful, she will take your money in a big hurry! She doesn't like to lose so she'll fold on a weak hand but bet hard on a strong one.\r\n\r\nCowboy: The Cowboy is a tough one to figure out. Maybe he's had a tough day and is distracted. Maybe he's just not very good at poker. Sometimes he'll fold on a good hand and bluff a bad one. However, if he has a really good hand, he'll usually bet.\r\n\r\nKid: The Kid is in town looking for a good time. He has money to burn and has been in the Casino a bit too long. His loose and passive play can be irritating. He'll make a mistake or two but be careful, he can fool you into losing your money!\r\n\r\nGambler: The Gambler is a bona fide \"shark\" and knows the odds. He is here for one reason only - to take your money! He plays tight and aggressive which means he'll usually bet on a hand he thinks can win. If he doesn't think he'll win a hand, he'll fold so be careful when he decides to bet. He'll bluff every now and then, just to keep you on your toes.\r\n\r\nLearn to Play:\r\nYou have many options for hints and strategy.

A series of exciting sound effects punctuates your child's taps and salutes them with uplifting chimes each time the problem is successfully completed, an option parents can customize within the app's preferences menu.\r\n\r\nThe game's activities help the children develop the following basic numbers and arithmetic skills:\r\n\r\nCounting\r\n\r\nChildren can learn their numbers from 1 to 20 by counting up, or down, using the app's large, kid-friendly back and forward buttons.\r\n\r\n{Parents can choose to have the numbers spoken in one of eight languages (English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Russian, Chinese, and Japanese) and set the numbers to appear sequentially or randomly.}\r\n\r\nRecognizing and Comparing Numbers\r\n\r\nTwo activities specifically encourage your child's number comparison and recognition skills: Find the Largest Number and Find the Smallest Number. With each game, a series of hot air balloons descend from the top of the screen and bob up and down. The narrator encourages the child to pick the balloon with the largest or the smallest number.\r\n\r\nThe constant motion and varying number of the balloons, from two to four, along with the large number range, from 1 to 99, promotes concentration and quick thinking.\r\n\r\nFinding a Match\r\n\r\nParents can encourage their child's memory skills with the Find a Match game. Based on the classic turn-over tile memory game format, children are prompted to find the matching numbers hiding beneath a field of cloud-shaped tiles. The number of clouds can be set in the context menu for this activity.\r\n\r\nLearning Addition and Subtraction\r\n\r\nTwo activities guide children through the basics of addition and subtraction using apples and pears, and a third, advanced exercise, combines the two.\r\n\r\nChildren are given a problem to solve, four answer choices, and visual clues to help them find the right answer.\r\n\r\nThe advanced exercise provides a series of combined addition and subtraction problems with numerals ranging from 1 to 99. The multiple choice format of the addition and subtraction games stays the same, but this activity eliminates visual references--no orchard fruit to help your child figure out the right answer.\r\n\r\nIf you want your child to learn math--and enjoy it--you'll love Kids Numbers and Math, and so will your little one!","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH6CM7N","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The Unknown City (Horror Begins Now.......Episode 1)","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.30957.13510798886625213.d5794714-68a9-4f84-9ded-1017e9b0ac6c.4cc43b3b-bb82-4415-b8b9-a7b5136d4477","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.33716.13510798886625213.d5794714-68a9-4f84-9ded-1017e9b0ac6c.ba3cce5f-7e97-4fab-ac32-5f852158ff00","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.19892.13510798886625213.d5794714-68a9-4f84-9ded-1017e9b0ac6c.12d0528e-2049-47a4-999b-7f272203efcf","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52336.13510798886625213.d5794714-68a9-4f84-9ded-1017e9b0ac6c.209b3455-74d5-4ad4-a963-5fd0b0d67df4","Height":2160,"Width":1440,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"StrikethroughPrice":"CAD $12.79","DisplayPrice":"CAD $1.91⁺","Price":1.91,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["YASHFUTURETECHSOLUTIONSPV.407141F15E750_rs8r5b65h5hnj"],"ContentIds":["b22d2617-80ca-f95f-bb32-b8d05c887e05","744dc0ec-d7a8-800c-7a06-b450d962f95e"],"Badges":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V3.ProductBadge, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","StyleKey":"Default","Text":"SAVE CAD $10.88","Type":"Merchandized"}],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"  ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One,Mobile","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"The Unknown City is a First Person Shooter game series based on a Horror Theme wrapped inside a gripping story along with amazing effects with a climax that will leave the players wanting to play next episodes of this series.

You ride in outdoor locations on a time-based race. The goal is to complete each round as fast as possible, but World Enduro Rally will give you bonus time if you perform stunts like backflips, frontflips (and other hidden stunts), and will add penalty time each time you re-spawn.\r\n\r\nEnduro bikes are heavy, and controlling tilt is sometimes hard. They don't brake much either, so you need to plan your speed carefully. The game includes speed signs to give you tips about when you can drive fast, or when you should drive slowly. \r\n\r\nMore bikes and locations will keep coming! \r\n\r\nWe’re on Twitter (@WEnduroRally) and Facebook (@worldEnduroRally).","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NV9G68XNPD5","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Sudoku Interactive 16x16","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.53776.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.a5da5ffd-779c-4811-a7e2-ac67168ab9d1","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4756.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.809a84e5-7350-4bed-b151-6dade480cc2d","Height":225,"Width":225,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60300.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.83737797-2424-4725-b058-807b3e3230aa","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.65172.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.5b6abc8a-749a-4a11-a044-6f657e2de034","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.60248.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.c5e40d4f-f42e-4974-82aa-24e66a87abfa","Height":225,"Width":465,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.1236.14402723396064646.1908a56b-4b1d-4169-932e-0ff7fcfa75d7.dcd39e4b-c51f-4bbb-b455-9172c3ad5273","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"black","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.62407.14402723396064646.3cad352b-cb3a-4a72-a5ca-3a06421999be.80a918a0-9704-4e59-872e-3810e57cf024","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":1.0,"RatingsCount":"1","PackageFamilyNames":["56694ArrayLabs.SudokuInteractive16x16_ebys1bhnt78wr"],"ContentIds":["9b78d062-b559-6c66-3260-72bc06a94953","3aa4b080-1d4f-4331-ad37-0f6be3b78a94"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,HoloLens","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Unlimited Sudoku games in 16x16 size grid. \r\n\r\nNo advertisements.\r\n\r\nFast puzzle generation (averages 10 seconds). \r\n\r\nDark background for reading comfort and longer battery life.\r\n\r\nSupports touch screen, keyboard, and game controller inputs.

The interactive objects can be used for learning landing and precise model control. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the fixed point camera that represents the RC pilot point of view, we have included follow up camera that allows for walking behind the model.

Moreover, once you manage to reach the bottom level of the dungeon and slay Lord Slyn, you'll also have to fight your way and survive the road back to the surface.\r\n\r\nMultiple player classes with awesome abilities\r\n\r\nBefore starting your quest you will have to choose one of the five possible hero classes: fighter, mage, paladin, priest, and ranger.\r\n\r\nEach of these classes come with unique strengths and weaknesses that will require a different approach when confronting the enemies from the dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, as most rogulike games, death is final so advance carefully and engage in battles only when you're sure you can come out victorious or you'll have to start the adventure from the very beginning.\r\n\r\nBesides monsters, the dungeon is also the place where you will find lots of weapons, equipment and consumables with different properties. While some can give you an instant boost to your skills, other can be cursed and besides their negative effects will bind to your hero needing you to remove their curse if you want to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nSpell books, potions, and magic wands can also be found during your adventure but, will require identification scrolls if you don't want to risk casting a curse on yourself or drinking a deadly potion.\r\n\r\nThe game packs lots of content regarding weapons, equipment, and other consumables which combined with the random dungeon generator, makes it deliver a completely unique experience each time you play it.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel,

The memories still burn deeply, like spicy chicken wings.\r\n\r\n\"They came without warning, squawking menacingly, their ruffled feathers darkening the sun. Invading intergalactic chickens, out to punish humanity for our oppression of their earthly brethren.\r\n\r\n\"I instantly knew what had to be done. I dropped my half-eaten chicken burger and jumped in my cockpit. With a greasy finger I set my lasers to \"extra crispy\" and blasted off to intercept the fowl invaders.\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't easy. Squawks, feathers flying, the smell of charred chicken everywhere. Three times they invaded, each time with increasingly devious plans. Three times I managed to push them back whence they came, and secure humanity a few more years as the dominant species of this planet.\r\n\r\n\"After their last retreat, I headed for my local Space Burger to bask in the glow of my recent victory. Breathing a sigh of relief, I sat down to enjoy a double chicken-burger with crispy chicken wings on the side.\r\n\r\n\"Little did I know that my greatest adventure was yet to come...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ultimate Omelette\" is the title of the fourth episode in the Chicken Invaders series of casual space shooter games. The game puts players at the forefront of a battle against invading intergalactic chickens, bent on revenge against the human race for our oppression of Earth chickens. In this episode, the chickens have constructed a gigantic cannon capable of launching planet-scale eggs against Earth, with the ultimate goal of encrusting humanity in an impenetrable wall made of egg white. Joined by an unlikely ally, players will travel to foreign, unexplored galaxies in an effort to locate and destroy the egg cannon before it reaches Earth.\r\n\r\nThe enemy repertoire has been significantly broadened, introducing several different kinds of chickens which attack relentlessly in colorful groups and meticulously choreographed formations. The chicken fray is punctuated by fights against boss enemies spanning up to three times the size of the screen. The arsenal at the player's disposal has also been correspondingly extended, with three new weapons and four kinds of supporting satellites providing additional firepower. The player's intergalactic journey is also accentuated by unique fantastic scenarios, such as navigating through a field of gigantic floating feathers, or dodging molten planet chunks during a supernova explosion.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NBLGGH5QLK6","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Wall Ball for Kinect","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.52840.13510798887150059.b33db019-1e41-49ad-aa1f-21ec0efeeede.e27d9d82-55a1-401d-9d47-939ea58cdba3","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.15966.13510798887150059.2d06db64-78fe-415f-a3e0-fafa2e37c9f6.ecbaad33-6b91-411d-af9f-ffa7a8ff88aa","Height":150,"Width":310,"BackgroundColor":"#000000","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.59","Price":3.59,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["34088MixxusStudio.WallBallforKinect_n714pv7s41yej"],"ContentIds":["4ae6c956-a6c6-f99e-79b0-c4e7a9697e44"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Play ball in the park, using Kinect for Xbox One with Windows\r\n\r\n• This application requires the Kinect for Xbox One sensor and a Kinect Adapter for Windows.\r\n• Make sure your system is compatible with the Kinect for Xbox One sensor with the Kinect Configuration Verifier tool, available in the Kinect for Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) 2.0 at https://dev.windows.com/en-us/kinect\r\n\r\nABOUT THE GAME\r\nTake a break and go to the park and play football (or Soccer ball) against a wall and try to hit some extra items that pop up from time to time.\r\nThis is something that many of us did as kids, kicking a ball endlessly or for a few minutes. It's also a great way for grownups to clear one's mind, or get into that trance or meditative state when thoughts can ramble around as they want.  \r\nYou can play Wall Ball in standard mode, with a pretty fast ball, or in easy mode with a rather large and slower moving ball, or you can even play in seated mode, suitable for people with some physical impairment or if you just feel very tired.\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL STUFF:\r\nBefore starting the game, Make sure you have the Kinect camera (sensor) properly installed on your computer. Follow instructions from Microsoft website to install Kinect and the necessary SDK software  http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44561 \r\nTo use Kinect for Xbox One on your computer, you need the Kinect Adapter for Windows. After installation of the Kinect software you should be able to see the Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0 in your app menu. \r\nFind a good spot to play where the Kinect camera can view you from head to feet. You can easily check this with the software that follows with the installation of the Kinect SDK software. You can for instance run Kinect Studio v2.0 (under Kinect for Windows SDK v2.0) to view yourself in front of the Kinect.\r\nIf everything looks ok, then you can start the Wall Ball game.\r\nIt can be recommended to connect your computer to a larger monitor or TV screen (using a HDMI cable) to  improve the \"feel\" of the game and making it easier to see.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS:\r\n•\tFree the space around you to not hurt yourself or to break any furniture. (Think about arms could be waving upwards too.)\r\n•\tIf children are playing they should be supervised and instructed by parents to not hurt themselves bumping into furniture.\r\n•\tIf other people are present in the room, make sure they are not in front of the camera and that they are at a safe distance from you bumping in to them.\r\n•\tIf you experience problem with balance, consider sitting down when playing.\r\n\r\nQUICK START\r\nBefore you start, make sure Kinect is properly installed and you have tested a good spot for playing where the Kinect sensor can \"read\" you properly, see above under \"Technical stuff\". If you have two graphic cards on your system, run the game with the better card otherwise it can affect Kinect/game performance. (For example, if you have a nvidia card you can manage this in nvidia control panel, manage 3D settings.)\r\nStart the game by pressing the Wall Ball icon.\r\nFrom the Main Menu (start screen), choose one of the three game variants Standard or Easy version or if you would like to sit down and play, choose Seated mode. The ball is somewhat larger and slower in Easy and Seated mode.\r\nWith the Toggle Show Settings (down at the right corner), you can adjust for your camera's placement above the floor. It is recommended to fine tune this. If the camera height setting are too low, you will feel like your feet are really heavy and won't lift properly. If it's to high, your feet will float in the air. The camera height slider correspond to the Kinect sensor's placement above the floor, however if it is tilted, you may have to adjust the slider more.\r\nStand in front of the Kinect camera, let the camera know you're there by moving slightly. When camera has found you, start kicking.\r\nKick the ball by using your right or left foot. When aiming, remember this is virtual reality so aim in a real world scale, not just in a small tv screen scale, that is, play like you were in the park yourself facing a large wall about 4 meters in front of you.\r\nIf the ball touches the area right behind you (an area as wide as the yellow area you're standing on) you will lose one ball. \r\nTo prevent the ball from hitting this area, you can stop the ball with your \"body\", shown as a silhouette, or just use your feet. You can slide from side to side inside the yellow area and crunch (you can't really move forward or backward, only as far as your legs can reach).\r\n\r\nIf you have lost all of your five balls, the game will end and you can choose to save, restart or exit. You choose between alternatives by putting your foot in one of the boxes, in this way you can restart instantly if you would like without the need to reach for the computer. You can also click on the signs with the mouse. From the Start screen, you can click on Result Menu where you can view your results.\r\n\r\nVideo tutorial: https://youtu.be/qFTv-q2cccg\r\nPDF tutorial: http://www.mixxusstudio.com/game-production/kinect-games\r\n","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N7VCNJXND05","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"The World Of One","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.23927.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.a4a1e297-d6c6-4100-9db9-ffc71557ec1f","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.4499.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.60029103-0efe-437a-b3ac-8d36fd975ea4","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.27875.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.3f41324f-30e7-402f-82de-4d8df4c966fb","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.7115.14057276012267442.4850d6ca-360d-45d0-9ee1-b5899489ff17.01b07c83-8760-4fcd-bb78-fd9ef0dc688a","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"CAD $3.89","Price":3.89,"AverageRating":0.0,"RatingsCount":"0","PackageFamilyNames":["53E4EFE6.WorldOfOneUWP_153j13zhvfy8w"],"ContentIds":["9e2eb025-9e23-57ce-8a61-4f409a1443dd","07348945-087a-4b8d-7aed-570016d6976c"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":" ","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC,Xbox One","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"\"Imagine...\r\nYou live in your own small world that has everything you need – cozy home, backyard with a rocking chair, beautiful garden, and your own amusement park with music and unlimited amounts of fireworks to launch.

She has come there because she believes that the ancient tombs in this place are not sufficiently explored. She thinks that the tombs are actually forgotten and someone has to see what is hiding there.\r\n\r\nDuring her visit to the tombs in Luxor, Nicole realizes that he was right in her assumptions because very soon she starts discovering new things. Namely, she starts finding a lot of valuable objects including eight mummies undiscovered until now. This seems like a really important discovery but the findings don't stop here. Additionally Nicole discovers small statues that weren't found before in Egypt or on any other place around the world. She knows that her discovery is huge so she goes more into details and continues exploring every possible place really carefully.\r\n\r\nLet's look around together with Nicole and see what those tombs hide.
