Recall your childhood!\r\n\r\nLudo game that traces its lineage to 6th century India. Ludo is derived from game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game.\r\n\r\nLudo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.\r\n\r\nThe game is played between 2 to 4 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.\r\n\r\nWhoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nLudo King is a game that was played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the game play might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You’ll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9NZQPT0MWTD0","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Asphalt 9: Legends","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.31655.14471421918435459.d2545274-048a-4f89-9a3e-6bc2a22507b0.7d654189-a632-4700-ba48-9b9ed2e831db","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.36500.14471421918435459.d2545274-048a-4f89-9a3e-6bc2a22507b0.c84cdf15-75c1-4226-ac00-e309b3551dff","Height":150,"Width":150,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"Poster","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.17053.14471421918435459.d2545274-048a-4f89-9a3e-6bc2a22507b0.774e9c95-5d69-42da-bb6b-14b082e2db63","Height":1080,"Width":720,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"BoxArt","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.63266.14471421918435459.d2545274-048a-4f89-9a3e-6bc2a22507b0.b25faed4-a958-4fd0-a3e8-dacd6d2e98ba","Height":1080,"Width":1080,"BackgroundColor":"","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free⁺","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":4.4,"RatingsCount":"85","PackageFamilyNames":["A278AB0D.Asphalt9_h6adky7gbf63m"],"ContentIds":["66ecceac-0752-a39e-ad43-b200c0bf8b97"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"Take on the world’s most fearless drivers and become the next Asphalt Legend – from the creators of Asphalt 8: Airborne.\r\n\r\nAsphalt 9: Legends features an extensive roster of real hypercars from renowned manufacturers such as Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini and W Motors.

Edit. Share. Smile. The free Adobe Photoshop Express app provides photo magic at your fingertips. \r\n\r\nJoin millions of creative folks who trust and use Adobe Photoshop Express for fast, powerful, and easy editing. This is the one-stop shop for your quick and fabulous photo editing needs.\r\n\r\nUse Adobe Photoshop Express to create better looking pictures. Use slide bar adjustments or automatic one-touch fixes to achieve great results. If you’re new to the app, here are few ways to improve your photos:\r\n\r\nINTRODUCING NEW LOOKS AND BORDERS:\r\n\r\nCREATIVE LOOKS:\r\n\r\n* Now choose from more than 45 eye-catching effects called Looks! Control the intensity of Looks with a simple slider. Different categories of Looks like Black and White, Portrait, Nature, Pop Color, and Duo Tones help to get you the right effect to apply.\r\nBORDERS:\r\n\r\n* Use our newly added Borders to add a distinctive personal touch to your photos with 30+ borders and frames. Express yourself!\r\nEDIT PHOTOS:\r\n\r\n* Quickly open photos from the device.\r\n* Snap pictures from right within the app.\r\n* Edit photos to their possible best. An easy to use interface provides seamless switching between various edits.\r\n* The comprehensive photo editor allows you to polish your photos so that you can turn your imagination to reality.\r\n\r\nCROP:\r\n\r\n* Fix photos fast — crop, straighten, rotate clockwise and anticlockwise, flip horizontal and vertical.\r\n\r\n* Crop also provides easy one-touch default aspect ratios.\r\n\r\nCORRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nMake your photos pop with simple sliders:\r\n\r\n* Control and set contrast, clarity, saturation, vibrance, dehaze\r\nUse these controls in your photos to produce stunning results. \r\nContrast is an attention-grabbing control that can turn your ordinary photo into a dazzling masterpiece.\r\nAdjust the color saturation using the Vibrance and Saturation controls.\r\nAdjust clarity slider to reveal more texture and detail in your photos.\r\nUse the Dehaze slider to add or remove haze from your photo.\r\n\r\n* Exposure, highlights, shadows, blacks and whites\r\nYou can fine-tune the photo’s exposure setting using the Exposure adjustment controls. Highlights and Shadows are the best way to optimize your photo’s exposure in highlights, midtones, and shadows, without compromising on other areas of tonality.\r\nUse Blacks and Whites to set black point and white point of the photo. This makes colors appear completely black or white.\r\n\r\n* Temperature and Tint\r\nUse Temperature and Tint controls to introduce warmth or coldness to your photo. You can also control the amount of green and red tones in your photo.\r\nUse the Temperature slider controls to increase or decrease the amount of orange or blue tone. Increasing the amount of orange introduces warmth to your photo. Increasing the amount of blue introduces coldness to your photo.\r\nUse the Tint slider control to add more red or green tone to your photo. Auto White-Balance does this automatically for you.\r\n\r\n* Details\r\nUse Sharpen, Reduce Luminance Noise, and Reduce Color Noise to make photos look more beautiful and minimize unwanted grain and speckling in your photos.\r\n\r\n* Split Tone\r\nStylize your photos through color tints in the highlights and shadows.\r\n\r\n* Blur\r\nUse the Blur effect to give your images an enhanced, surreal effect.\r\n\r\n* Fade\r\nBlend images with the background using the new “Fade” effect and give a matte feel to your photos.\r\n\r\n*Vignette Effect\r\nAdd a sentimental feeling or evoke nostalgia to your images using the Vignette effect.\r\n\r\nSPOT HEAL\r\n* Removing spots or blemishes have never been so easy! Remove pimples, scars, dirt and dust from your photos with one touch.\r\n\r\nREMOVE RED EYE AND FIX PET EYE:\r\n\r\n* Just a tap is required to remove red-eye of people or pets in photos.\r\nYou can use the Red Eye tool to reduce the red eyes in the subjects of your photo. This desaturates the red pixels within the target area and reduces the effect.\r\n\r\nAUTO FIX: \r\n\r\n* Edit your photos with a one-touch auto adjustment.\r\n\r\nRAW PHOTO SUPPORT:\r\n*Photoshop Express supports the following file formats:\r\n• Photo: JPG, PNG\r\n• Raw files: arw (SONY), cr2 (CANON), crw (CANON), dng, erf (EPSON), raf (FUJI), 3fr and fff (HASSELBLAD), dcr (KODAK), mrw (KONICA), mos (LEAF), rwl (LEICA), nef and nrw (NIKON), orf (OLYMPUS), rw2 (PANASONIC), pef (PENTAX), srw (SAMSUNG.\r\nPRINT FEATURE: \r\n* Print the edited photos directly using your Windows device.\r\nSTORE AND SHARE:\r\n\r\n* Your original photo is not lost during editing.

However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\r\n\r\nPlay LUDO KING, Ludo with Friends NOW for

The 28 domino tiles are shuffled face down and form the stock or boneyard. Each player draws seven tiles; the remainder are not used. Once the players begin drawing tiles, they are typically placed on-edge before the players, so that each player can see his own domino tiles, but none can see the value of other players' tiles. Every player can thus see how many tiles remain in the other players' hands at all times during gameplay. One player begins by downing (playing the first tile) one of their tiles. In different games first tiles are also different. In Muggins player should start with the highest double (6-6), in Bergen the first move should be 0-0, in Mexican train each round starts with the next lower double. This tile starts the line of play, a series of tiles in which adjacent tiles touch with matching, i.e. equal, values. The players alternately extend the line of play with one tile at one of its two ends. The game ends when one player wins by playing their last tile, or when the game is blocked because neither player can play. If that occurs, whoever caused the block gets all of the remaining player points not counting their own.\r\n- Scoring game\r\nPlayers accrue points during game play for certain configurations, moves, or emptying one's hand. Most scoring games use variations of the draw game. In Muggins (All fives) player must make the open ends of the layout add up to 5s or a multiple of five (5s, 10, 15, 20, etc.) In bergen player scores when numbers on the open ends are equal. If a player does not call \"domino\" before the tile is laid on the table, and another player says 'domino' after the tile is laid, the first player must pick up an extra domino. In Mexican train the double zero domino is scored as 50 points.\r\n- Draw game\r\nIn a draw game (blocking or scoring), players are additionally allowed to draw as many tiles as desired from the stock before playing a tile. The score of a game is the number of pips in the losing player's hand plus the number of pips in the stock. Most rules prescribe that two tiles need to remain in the stock. The Draw game is often referred to as simply \"dominos\".\r\n\r\nIf you like board games like Checkers, Mahjong, Backgammon and Chess, you will love Dominoes: Best Classic Dominoes Board Game.","ProductFamilyName":"Games","Schema":"Card;1"},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V8.One.CardModel, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ProductId":"9N6Z22CT0TRG","TileLayout":"Poster","Title":"Pics Words Trivia","Images":[{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25849.14004866404550707.b2e93be8-8a5b-472d-bbd9-7e5363c08a06.b0b0afc5-b81f-4c1c-aefa-d0074e51bbc7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"tile","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.37839.14004866404550707.b2e93be8-8a5b-472d-bbd9-7e5363c08a06.420bf325-db5b-4a8b-aae5-63645a92a0dc","Height":300,"Width":620,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""},{"$type":"Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts.V2.ImageItem, Microsoft.Marketplace.Storefront.Contracts","ImageType":"logo","Url":"http://store-images.s-microsoft.com/image/apps.25849.14004866404550707.b2e93be8-8a5b-472d-bbd9-7e5363c08a06.b0b0afc5-b81f-4c1c-aefa-d0074e51bbc7","Height":300,"Width":300,"BackgroundColor":"#FFFFFF","ForegroundColor":"","Caption":"","ImagePositionInfo":""}],"DisplayPrice":"Free","Price":0.0,"AverageRating":3.7,"RatingsCount":"3","PackageFamilyNames":["57591LegendsSonicSagaGame.PicsWordsTrivia_78eft1qs6c52t"],"ContentIds":["97d833b1-00bf-3c03-a689-e69b4e02c38a","ba8bb1e6-b3e7-600c-8acf-8e5d7d0a68ec"],"GamingOptionsXboxLive":false,"AvailableDevicesDisplayText":"","AvailableDevicesNarratorText":"PC","TypeTag":"app","RecommendationReason":"","LongDescription":"THE #1 HIT WITH OVER 100,000,000 PLAYERS WORLDWIDE! \r\nFind out why everyone loves this game and JOIN THE FUN NOW!\r\nIf you like brain games, you will love Pics Words Trivia  - it's a fun word game in which your goal is to find words that fit to the shown picture. \r\n\r\n★THE MOST ADDICTIVE BRAINTEASER IN THE WORLD!★\r\n\r\nPics Words Trivia is a very addictive brain game that will catch you for hours!\r\n\r\nEvery picture has words associated to it.

Players collect rent from their opponents, with the goal being to drive them into bankruptcy. \r\n\r\nMoney can also be gained or lost through Chance and Community Chest cards, and tax squares; players can end up in jail, which they cannot move from until they have met one of several conditions.
